0	0	ACS-UH	1010X	Anthropology and the Arab World	How have anthropologists encountered, written about, and produced the “Arab world” over the past century? Beginning with early Western travelers’ imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.	0	0
1	1	ACS-UH	1011X	Introduction to Modern Arabic Literature	This course provides an overview of Arabic literature since the nineteenth century. The transformation of poetic form and the emergence of modern genres, such as drama, the novel, and the short story, will be examined in relation to classical Arabic and European genres. We will also discuss the relationship between aesthetic developments and their historical, political, and intellectual contexts.	0	0
2	2	ACS-UH	1012X	Emergence of the Modern Middle East	At the crossroads between Asia, Africa and Europe, the region that Europeans and North Americans labeled “The Middle East” presents a dynamic and heterogeneous landscape of peninsulas and isthmuses, republics and monarchies, oil producing countries, and labor exporting nations. This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010-2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.	0	0
3	3	ACS-UH	1211X	UAE from Pre-History to 2030: History, Environment, Society and Culture	A selection of themes and topics providing a broad perspective of Emirati history and culture are covered in this introduction to the United Arab Emirates. The class consists largely of presentations by guest experts as well as a selection of readings designed to provide a deep insight into the past and future of the nation. Students are required to keep a journal and submit a research paper on a relevant topic of their choice.	0	0
4	4	ACS-UH	1212J	Modern Architecture in Abu Dhabi	(Formerly ACS-AD 263J)This course is an exploration of modern architecture in the city. Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.	0	0
5	5	ACS-UH	1410X	Making of the Muslim Middle East	Islam changed and shaped the Middle East, the Mediterranean world, and South Asia following its emergence in the seventh century. Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi’a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.	0	0
6	6	ACS-UH	1411X	First Islamic World Empire: The Abbasids	Founded in the year 750 C.E., the Abbasid caliphate was one of the world’s great empires. At the height of its strength, the Abbasid caliph ruled over a vast region extending from North Africa to Central Asia. This course will examine the historical rise of the Abbasids as a watershed moment in the history of Late Antiquity that would have a profound and lasting impact on the political, religious, intellectual life of Eurasia for the next millennium. Through an engagement with primary texts and secondary studies across a wide variety of Islamicate intellectual disciplines (historical writing, philosophy, law, theology, science, political theory and belles-lettres), students in this class will come to understand some of the complex dynamics that went into the formation of a distinctive Islamic state and society, and what consequences Abbasid rule would have for later generations.	0	0
7	7	ACS-UH	1412X	Race and Ethnicity in the Histories of the Middle East and Africa	How have the inhabitants of the Middle East and Africa conceived of social difference? Beginning in Late Antiquity and then with the spread of Islam into the Middle East and North Africa, this course will explore the social, cultural and political contingencies that gave rise to ethnic and racial identities within and beyond the Muslim world. How did these identities and categories change over time and in which ways were they impacted by the Indian Ocean, Atlantic, and Saharan slave trades, local social and political factors, European colonialism and then de-colonization in the twentieth century? What are the terms and meanings attached to skin color or social difference in the Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Berber, Swahili, Songhai, Amharic, or Turkish speaking worlds? How are these constructed and controlled? Who gave these categories meaning and why? What are the obstacles to discussing and identifying race particular to the histories of these regions, their peoples, and their histories? In order to answer these questions, the course will draw extensively on primary sources, historical research, as well as theoretical writings on race and ethnicity.	0	0
8	8	ACS-UH	1610X	Feminism and Islamism in the Middle East and North Africa	What does it mean to identify as a “feminist” or an “Islamist” in the MENA region today, and to what extent are those terms philosophically and politically compatible? Is feminism itself - and movements for gender equality and LGBTQ rights in the region more broadly - a legacy of colonialism and Western influence/ intervention? Or do such movements have local, organic roots expressed through Islamic texts and history, and even Islamist forms of political activism? How can we appraise the track record of so-called Islamist movements (e.g.: Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, Turkey’s AK Parti, Tunisia’s Ennahdha Party, and Morocco’s Freedom and Justice Party and Al-Adl wal Ihsan movement) on promoting women’s rights and gender inclusivity in comparison to states, secularly oriented political movements, and jihadist movements in the region? Students in this course will explore these questions by critically engaging with historical texts and country case studies, in addition to materials produced by and about feminist, Islamic, and Islamist actors.	0	0
9	9	ACS-UH	2210JX	Cities and Modern Arabic Literature	We use fiction as a tool to visit (figuratively) five cities: Cairo, Alexandria, Beirut, Haifa, and Baghdad. The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.	0	0
10	10	ACS-UH	2211JX	Orientalism Debates	In 1978 Edward Said published Orientalism, a book that presented a strong critique of Western scholarship on the Middle East. Thirty-five years later it is hard to find a discipline in the humanities and the social sciences that has not been influenced by the book, which is often credited with having founded the field of post-colonial studies. In this course we will read Orientalism, study Said’s complex relationship with the work of Foucault, his long feud with Bernard Lewis, the influence of Orientalism on fields as disparate as art history and political science, and read the works of recent critics of Said such as Daniel Varisco and Robert Irwin.	0	0
11	11	ACS-UH	2212X	Introduction to Islamic Texts	This class is divided roughly into two broad sections: in the first half of the semester samples of the Qur’an are read, translated and analyzed for orthographic and phonetic features, as well as structure and meaning and basic aspects of variegated styles within the developing scripture. Early Surahs are read, as well as, later, samples of narrative and, in the last section, of legalistic (i.e. Medinan) materials. In the second half of the semester we read examples of Hadith and Qur’anic exegesis, highlighting throughout the styles and protocols of this literature. The Hadith come mostly out of Bukhari and the Sirah of the Prophet; and the exegesis includes readings from Baydawi, Qurtubi, Razi and Qushayri (the last being an example of mystical hermeneutics).	0	0
12	12	ACS-UH	2410X	Paradise Lost: Muslims, Christians and Jews in Al-Andalus	From the beginning of the 8th to the beginning of the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while Al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of Al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.	0	0
13	13	ACS-UH	2411X	"Heritage, History and Memory in the Modern ""Middle East"""	How do those who live in the Middle East relate to their past(s), and what discourses do they draw on to represent and authorize it today? How is the past recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.	0	0
14	14	ACS-UH	2412JX	Interwoven Pasts of Spain and Morocco	At the western end of the Mediterranean, the religious, political, and economic histories of North Africa and Iberia have always been intertwined. This was especially the case during the eight centuries from 711-1492 when various parts of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled over by Muslims. In this course we look both at how what are today Morocco and Spain were connected in this period in both history and imagination, and at how the Spanish colonial presence in Morocco in the 20th century played an important role in the Spanish civil war. The course includes an extended trip through Morocco and Spain.	0	0
15	15	ACS-UH	2413JX	Arab Crossroads in China	(Formerly ACS-AD 205JX)This is a course about overseas Arab communities in an entirely foreign cultural and political setting—China. Arabs came to China to trade and settled there as early as the 9th century. They prospered and had a long and rich history. How did they preserve they culture? In what ways did they change? In this course, we will immerse ourselves in the lives and cultures of the Arab merchant communities that settled in China from the early days of Islam until the early modern period. We will learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the “Arabian Seas.” We will learn to think like medieval seamen and seawomen. We will read the narratives of Arab merchants such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who  came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries. We will also read the rihla travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta who traveled from North Africa to China in the 14th century. We will study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history—the Tang, Song, and Yuan and early Ming dynasties. We will also read the narratives of later Arab navigators such as Ahmad ibn al-Majid. To complement the Arab travelogues, we will read the narrative of Ma Huan--the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. In addition to reading texts, we will study in depth several sites such as Canton (Guangdong), and Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon (Zayton), the city that was dominated by Arab merchants for several centuries. We will also visit one of the earliest sites of Muslim settlement in China—the small community of Yangzhou, north of Shanghai. We will visit the old mosques in the town and the Arab cemetery. In Shanghai, we will visit the “Friday market” in the Muslim quarter.	0	0
16	16	ACS-UH	2414X	Jews in the Muslim World in the Middle Ages	This course examines the history and culture of the Jews in the medieval Islamic world, beginning with the historiographical debate about this contentious subject. The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur’an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.	0	0
17	17	ACS-UH	2415JX	History of Modern Iran	(Formerly ACS-AD 207JX)This course will cover major turning points in modern Iran, from the 1906 Constitutional Revolution to the 1979 Islamic Revolution and since. Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini’s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state’s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.	0	0
18	18	ACS-UH	2416JX	Oasis, Coast and Mountain: Landscapes of History and Culture in the UAE and Oman	This course challenges preconceptions of Arabian landscapes as mainly desert by exploring three distinct ecological zones in relation to each other: desert, maritime coast, and mountain chain. How have these zones been constituted naturally and historically, and how they are changing in the present era? Topics include the impacts of human settlement, especially on water resources, inter-regional and global trade, colonization, and urbanization. Finally, we will look at what governments and global institutions have done to address some problems emerging in these zones. Learning will take place through informal lectures, guided tours of key sites, activities such as walking, boating, and swimming to get an embodied sense for these zones, recording through sketching or photography, interviewing various people knowledgeable about the issues at hand, not to mention people affected by their changing surroundings. Daily diary writing is required, along with group discussions with instructors during the day, and a short final reflective paper.	0	0
19	19	ACS-UH	2417	Ottoman Crossroads	Connecting three continents for four centuries, the Ottoman Empire brought locations as far flung as Yemen, Tunisia and Bosnia into the same cultural, legal and economic space.  This course explores the Empire’s legacy in what has come to be known as the Middle East and beyond.  After examining themes in Ottoman history starting in the 13th century through to World War I, we will discuss the Empire’s legacy in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, revisiting our ideas about nation-states, constructions like the Middle East and the Arab World, and the boundaries between East and West.	0	0
20	20	ACS-UH	2418X	Politics and Cultures of Nationalism in the Modern Middle East	As one of the most influential political ideas that has shaped the modern world nationalism has had a long lasting impact on the history of the modern and contemporary Middle East. Covering the Arab World, Turkey and Iran this course examines nationalist cultures and political experiences across the region in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from the Ottoman and Qajar empires to the world of nation states that emerged after the First World War. The development of nationalism is analyzed from a variety of perspectives: as a state practice and idea of imperial reform and nation building; as a powerful social imaginary that mobilized increasing number of people in time and space; and as an ideological and narrative construction of nations as ‘natural’ entities anchored in mythical pasts.  This course places particular emphasis on various ‘entrepreneurs’ of nationalism: imperial, colonial and national governments, bureaucrats, intellectuals, educators, political activists, urban crowds, workers and peasants.	0	0
21	21	ACS-UH	2419X	Sufism	Mysticism is an integral aspect of every religious tradition. In recent years, however, Sufism or Islamic mysticism has often been described as somehow separate from Islam itself. In this course we will investigate the historical origins of Sufism and the nature of the long-standing tension between certain Sufi practices and the Muslim legal establishment. We will also chart the evolution of Sufism from personal spiritual practice and experience to the establishment of mystical brotherhoods in which, depending on time and place, a large portion of Muslim society participated. Finally, we will turn to the continued importance that Sufism has played in the Muslim World (including the Arab Gulf) and the United States during a period in which its practices have come under criticism. Sufi authors examined will include Rumi, al-Hallaj and Ibn al-Arabi.	0	0
22	22	ACS-UH	2610JX	Oil and Energy in the Middle East	This course provides an overview of the issues surrounding global energy supplies, oil’s unique economic properties, and its role in shaping the political economy of the Middle East and U.S. strategic interests in the region. We begin by discussing the basic science and availability of energy sources, the state of technology, the functioning of energy markets, the challenges of coping with global climate change and the key role of the oil reserves in the Middle East. The second part of the course focuses on the history of oil in the Middle East and its impact on societies in the region.	0	0
23	23	ACS-UH	2611X	War and Media in the Middle East	This course examines two simultaneous processes in the Middle East since the mid-20th century: 1) how war has become mediatized, and 2) how media has been militarized. Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies - including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet-are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.	0	0
24	24	ACS-UH	2613X	Youth in the Middle East	Roughly one third of the Middle East population today is between 15 and 29 years old - a demographic “bulge” which has brought Middle Eastern youths at the forefront of media and government concerns both at the regional and global scale. But from the figure of the young jihadist to that of the Arab spring revolutionary, dominant perceptions of these youths often fall into highly polarized archetypes. Moving the focus away from politics and religion, this course explores the everyday worlds of Middle Eastern youths and the complex interactions - with institutions, peers and family members - which characterize their daily lives. By analyzing multiple youth cultures divided along the lines of gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation, or social class, students will address the diversity of Middle Eastern youths and question the universality of age categories. A large space will also be devoted to the voices of Middle Eastern youths themselves, from Egyptian literature and Emirati cinema to Moroccan hip-hop. These cultural productions will allow students to look at the way Arab youths use globalized artistic genres to address regional issues and express their fears, hopes and desires.	0	0
25	25	ACS-UH	3010	Problems and Methods in Arab Crossroads Studies	This seminar introduces students to the main theoretical and epistemological trends in the study of the Arab crossroads region, and offers practical examples of the methodologies used by scholars in the humanities and the qualitative social sciences. We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.	0	0
26	26	ACS-UH	4000	Arab Crossroads Studies Senior Capstone Seminar	The capstone seminar is designed as a workshop offering graduating seniors a communal environment in which to conceptualize, share and refine a year-long research project, self-designed in consultation with a faculty advisor. In this semester, particular attention will be paid to the organization and practice of research as well as evidence, method and scholarly habit and process. The fall semester culminates in the presentation of significant writing (at least 20 pages/6000 words) toward the final scholarly product, the written and publicly presented capstone. Each student should also be working with their faculty advisor throughout the semester, submitting drafts to their advisor and working with her/him on the research process.	0	0
27	27	ACS-UH	4001	Arab Crossroads Studies Senior Capstone Project	The spring semester of the ACS Senior Capstone is composed of the student working in close consultation with a faculty member on their capstone project. It is expected that the student will meet weekly with their advisor.	0	0
28	28	AFRST-UH	1110J	Interdisciplinary Introduction to African Urban Studies	This course will draw from several disciplines to set out various ways of understanding the African city as both space and archive, with Accra serving as the primary case study. Students will be introduced to key aspects of urban spatial theory and to ways of doing streetside ethnography and nearby history. The course will be structured around a short novel and a play, with references to other African cities such as Lagos, Nairobi, and Johannesburg, among others. There will also be field trips to different parts of Accra, as well as to the Elmina and Cape Coast castles. Ultimately the objective of the course is to equip students with the interpretative and research skills to be able to understand and discuss any cities of their choice in dialogue with the best research in the field and in a lively and sophisticated manner.	0	0

30	30	AHC-UH	1003	Women’s Voices	(Formerly AHC-AD 134)As cultural traditions have for the most part carried the voices of men, this course will consider the question: what can we learn from listening to women? In this course students will listen to a range of women’s voices: novelists and poets, including Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Arundhati Roy; film-makers, including Shawn Slovo (“A World Apart”) and Haifaa al-Mansour (“Wadjda”); and scholars, including Martha Nussbaum (“The Fragility of Goodness”) and Leila Ahmed (“Border Passage”). Students will be asked to consider how these readings illuminate the human condition or throw light on aspects of human experience that challenge traditional assumptions, including assumptions about women and men.	0	0
31	31	AHC-UH	1004	Reading the Earth: World Literature and the Environment	(Formerly AHC-AD 135)This course introduces students to several genres of literature—drama, the novel, poetry, and the short story—and to some fundamental categories of literary criticism including Marxism, feminism, post-colonial theory, and eco-criticism. Students will examine conceptions of nature and how “the natural” is represented in texts, especially after the explosive growth of industrialization in Victorian England and its subsequent global diffusion. Each unit of the course is constructed around a particular problem that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings. In an attempt to address a representative range of eco-critical dilemmas, we will examine texts from around the world not only in terms of local and regional issues, but also with an eye towards a more global perspective. In attempting to conceptualize nature and the environment, it has become difficult not to think globally. Thinking about literature is increasingly becoming a parallel kind of exercise and students will be encouraged to explore the connections between a global world of texts and the larger natural environment that both shapes and is, in turn, shaped by them.	0	0
32	32	ANTH-UH	1010	Introduction to Anthropology	This course provides students with a broad overview of the discipline, history, research methods, and selected contemporary issues in the field. The approach taken selects key ethnographies and uses them to explore questions of a methodological, theoretical, and substantive nature. This course is designed to introduce students to anthropological investigation and to facilitate understanding of how the discipline engages with and represents the everyday realities, challenges, and concerns of the people with whom anthropologists work.	0	0
33	33	ANTH-UH	2110J	Anthropology of Indigenous Australia: Art, Politics and Cultural Futures	This course offers an introduction to some current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia, considering a range of Aboriginal forms of social being, ranging historically and geographically and focusing on the changing relationships between Indigenous people and the settler nation of Australia. Students will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms. While those in the dominant society first thought that Aboriginal people and their culture would “die out” and later that they would be simply “assimilated,” the course traces a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what Stanner called “the great Australian silence” and asserting their right to a cultural future. This includes assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course makes use of museums in Sydney, and prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present work relevant to the theme.	0	0
34	34	ANTH-UH	2112J	Cities and Globalization: Buenos Aires and Beyond	This course will examine current transformation apace across Latin American cities involving rapid urbanization, the growth of neoliberal developments and the transformation of creative industries and economies across the region. We will focus on post 1980s transformations when we see new modes of globalization across the region that presented new openings but also constraints in regards to the development of enclave urbanism, new types of segregation and new imaginaries of class and “urban” identities. Throughout, Buenos Aires will provide a case study and laboratory to explore some of these contemporary issues in greater detail. Special attention will be paid to the use of culture in urban development, such as through the rise of urban tourism and the marketing and internationalization of tango. Readings will be drawn from geography, urban studies, anthropology and cultural studies. Our discussion will also be enriched through films, guest speakers, guided tours, and among other exercises geared at enriching students’ appreciation of contemporary Buenos Aires.	0	0
35	35	ANTH-UH	2113	Memoir and Ethnography: Understanding Culture Through First-Person Narrative	Memoir is the best-selling genre in contemporary literature. Indeed, our fascination with all things autobiographical attests to the importance of examining one particular life in order to understand larger issues concerning culture, community, race, gender and even social and global transformations. Narrative Ethnography is also a form of writing which uses the first person pronoun. In this genre, “participant observation” - actually experiencing the beliefs, rituals and life-ways of another culture first hand - is the methodology employed in order to explicitly understand not just the self, but the ‘other’. What are the differences between memoir and ethnography? What kinds of knowledge travel in each? How does writing in the first person challenge other modes of knowledge production? How might memoir and ethnography contribute to our understanding of cultural and cross-cultural dialogue, while providing a post-colonial critique? In this course we examine the rhetorical and aesthetic rules that govern these genres, as well as the way they create social imaginations that go on to live political lives in the world.	0	0
36	36	ANTH-UH	2114X	Listening to Islam	What kinds of knowledge pass through the ear? In this course we understand Islam from the vantage point of aesthetics (from the Greek aisthesthai, to perceive). In particular, we explore sound knowledge – the kind of knowledge that comes through listening. What happens when we listen to Islam? And how does the concept of samaa – spiritual listening – inform the sound worlds of Islam? Examining Sunni and Shi’ite rituals, as well as celebrations, festivals, commemorations and ceremonies, we will read about and experience Islamic forms of expression order to understand the power of aesthetic performance in its local expression and on the global stage.	0	0
37	37	ANTH-UH	2115	Anthropology of Forced Migration	This course explores the lived experiences of exiles, refugees, and forced migrants, through anthropological texts on displacement, encampment, resettlement, asylum, memory, and belonging. It looks at how forced migrant identities are formed and transformed, and at notions of home, and belonging. The class examines interactions between forced migrants, aid agencies, governments and the UNHCR. The course explores each stage of forced migration, the institutions refugees encounter, the factors behind human movement, and the anthropology of social crisis. It also examines processes of flight and displacement in ethnography. We will also study the experience of encampment and its effect on social organizations, memory and identity. The class ex amines critiques of humanitarian assistance, scrutinizing micro-level practices of aid along with concerns regarding the modern state, its obligations, constraints, and approach to citizenship and belonging. The class then addresses asylum, immigration and the anthropology of borders and border crossing. To conclude, the course considers issues of integration and resettlement, examining how people make a new life in a different culture.	0	0
38	38	ANTH-UH	2116	Displacement and Dispossession in the Modern Middle East	Dispossession and forced migration have come to be a defining feature of the contemporary Middle East. Yet involuntary movement of peoples has indelibly marked the region throughout the last 150 years.  This course examines the history of forced migrations through an anthropological lens, engaging with concepts such as: space and place; ethnicity, identity; belonging, nationalism; cosmopolitanism, hybridity, and local conviviality; resilience, and integration. It engages with the forced migrations of the Circassians from the border lands of Imperial Russia, the Armenians, and the Kurds from Anatolia, and Palestinians, Iraqis and Syrians in the Levant.  The course addresses these dispossessions as part of the clash of empire, carried further by the colonial, neo-colonial as well as the contemporary neo-conservative political encounters.   It engages with the ways in which these peoples have developed a local cosmopolitanism and examines whether such local conviviality can survive the current displacement and eviction of peoples from Syria.	0	0
39	39	ANTH-UH	2117J	Migration and Displacement Across the Red Sea	More people have been forcibly displaced today than at any other time since the Second World War. While the majority of this population stems from Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, conflicts in several African and Arab nations have contributed to this record number of displaced persons globally. This course will familiarize students with a relatively undocumented migration “crisis” occurring at the borders of the Arabian Peninsula: the displacement of Yemeni refugees and African migrants across the Red Sea. A regional practicum will serve as a case study for exploring (1) the roots and development of this crisis, (2) the centuries’ long interconnections between communities straddling the Red Sea, and (3) the politics and ethics of humanitarian interventions.	0	0
40	40	ANTH-UH	2120	Philosophy and Anthropology Of Ethical Life	Does virtue lie within an ethical tradition or beyond it? What happens when ethical traditions collide? What freedoms do individuals exercise in striving for moral virtue? And how do the claims of others (friends, family, lovers, others) affect such freedoms? These questions have animated critical inquiry in both philosophical and anthropological thought. That is, they have been at the center of reasoned argumentation about ethics in philosophical traditions and a subject of empirical inquiry through ethnographic methods that examine ethical life in particular social settings. This course examines the conversation between philosophy and anthropology on these questions. What have anthropologists found attractive about philosophical concepts? What concepts have proven resilient to anthropological reception? And how can anthropological research be returned to philosophical inquiry? Readings include philosophical texts by Bergson, Cavell, Foucault, Laugier, MacIntyre and Nietzsche; and anthropological texts by Veena Das, James Laidlaw, Cheryl Mattingly, and others, which examine ethical life in India, Chile, Yemen, Iraq, and the United States.	0	0
41	41	ARABL-UH	1110	Elementary Arabic 1	This course is designed for learners with no prior knowledge of Arabic. Students who have studied Arabic before or who have prior knowledge of Arabic are required to take a placement test. This is a full semester (or equivalent session) course during which students first learn the Arabic alphabet, then move on to work on the sentence and paragraph levels.

56	56	ARTH-UH	1010	Foundations of Art History I	These courses offer detailed engagements with key works of art—masterpieces to material culture across a range of media from different times and places—to develop the critical apparatus of visual analysis. They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? The course will be conducted through both lecture and discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, PowerPoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history is required.	0	0

58	58	ARTH-UH	1110X	Introduction to Visual Culture	Visual Culture Studies branches away from traditional Art History towards new subjects and methodologies. The primary area of interest is not works of art but rather other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of Visual Culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.	0	0
59	59	ARTH-UH	1111	Contemporary Global Art	Since the 1960s rise of conceptual art, artists around the world continue to create idea-based art using popular imagery, mixed media, photography and new technologies. Considered as the true global art form of the twentieth century, conceptual art manifests itself in ideas that challenge the current sociopolitical forces of our times and the commonly held notions of what art is about. The course will examine contemporary art from the lens of conceptual art focusing on key works by international artists. Students will examine the definition/s of ‘contemporary’ and the current debates around the modern and contemporary in relation to Western and non-Western art.	0	0
60	60	ARTH-UH	1112J	Art & Architecture in Berlin	Berlin is a city in transformation. In this seminar we will focus on relationships between art and architecture in public places that make such transformations visible. We will explore how relationships of art and architecture are influenced by political, social and cultural contexts. We approach the topic by site visits e.g. the Place of the United Nations, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, Track 17, the Elliptical Pavilion and the 'Café Bravo' from the American artists Dan Graham. We will study more closely the connection of the planning of a space and the use of it. And how does a place get affected, if the space gets used for another purpose? The seminar is focused on art and architecture as main features of public places that make the larger environment and its historical, social and political contexts more conspicuous.	0	0
61	61	ARTH-UH	1113	Modern Art and Modernism	The term modernism encompasses the activities and creations of those who have felt since the late nineteenth century that traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious habit, social organization and ways of living are inadequate to the realities of an industrialized world. Such activities and creations have sought to initiate an understanding of the world that would ultimately lead to a new cultural, economic, social, and political environment. This movement has involved experimentation and the creation of an awareness of possibilities never thought of before as well as a constant change and competition, especially in the arts. The course will provide an art historical survey from the late 19th century to the late 1960s. It will focus primarily on Europe and the United States and will explore art movements, ideas and exemplary individual artworks, but also on the dynamics of the art historical development on the whole.	0	0
62	62	ARTH-UH	1114J	Politics of Modern Middle Eastern Art	From the Baathist regimes of Syria and Iraq to Egypt’s pan-Arabism under Gamal Abdel Nasser, paintings and sculptures in addition to film and performing art have been employed by various governments as a tool of soft power to propagate their policies to the public not only in their respective states but throughout the region and beyond. Despite this government patronage of the arts, many artists have chosen to challenge their authorities through their art practices. This course examines the political undertones of iconic artworks of the 20th century in the post World War II period in the Arab world as well as Iran, Turkey and Israel. Class discussions will shed light on an often neglected dimension in the modern history of the Arab world and other parts of the Middle East. The course includes field trips to art exhibitions and Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi's collection.	0	0
63	63	ARTH-UH	1115JX	Islamic Architecture: Formation to Revival	From the House of the Prophet in Medina in the 7th century to the high-rises of Dubai today, this course casts architecture as the most expressive embodiment of the historical conditions within which Islam was formed and acquired meaning, and to which it in turn gave form and context. Spanning fifteen centuries and three continents, the course focuses on key episodes from the foundational moments of an Islamic architecture in Arabia and the territories of the major cultures of Antiquity with which Islam came in contact to the interaction with the West in the age of colonialism, independence, development, and the consequent revival of Islamic architecture today while emphasizing the interconnectivity of cultures in shaping architecture. The analysis of buildings and cities is framed by discussion of religion, society, polity, and culture. Each class covers a specific time/place but keeps the thread of the entire story active and moving. The course is primarily an introductory overview. Its requirements include discussions and oral and graphic presentations that feed into a continuous enrichment of our understanding of Islamic architecture and history. Site visits constitute an integral part of the course. Possible field trips include the Byzantine and Umayyad sites in Jordan, the Louvre Abu-Dhabi, NYUAD campus, and select historically-inspired buildings in the UAE.	0	0
64	64	ARTH-UH	1810X	Art and Architecture of the Islamic World	A broad survey, we will consider works of architecture, ceramics, metalwork, textiles and the arts of the book.  Given the span of centuries embraced by the term ‘Islamic art’ – from the 7th century up to the present day – and the expanse of geography – from Spain to China and beyond – this course cannot be a complete survey within the constraints of a single semester. Instead, this course will present a select group of materials within a chronological and dynastic framework, with an emphasis on specific case studies.  These selections will highlight important internal developments as well as ‘points of contact’ between cultural entities.  This approach – at once global and local – speaks to the dynamic and fluid qualities of many of the arts produced in the regions under scrutiny.	0	0
65	65	ARTH-UH	2117	Contemporary Photography from the Middle East, South Asia, and the Far East	This course will introduce students to a wide range of contemporary photographic practices in the Middle East, South Asia, and the Far East. Through slide lectures, readings, museum visits and presentations by local artists, students will explore the issues that artists, photography collectives and competitions of the region are concerned with. This course will cover a range of genres, including Landscape, Performance, Portraiture, and Documentary.	0	0
66	66	ARTH-UH	2118X	Contemporary Art and Politics in the Arab World	In the short span of thirty years, art of the Arab World moved from the periphery of international art to the center of global visual art production. This course examines the conditions that prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists from key periods of art production, the course will explore the impact of political, social and market forces on the region’s art. Examining art production in relation to state formation, identity, gender politics, representation and reception, globalization, and activism. The course will also explore the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.	0	0
67	67	ARTH-UH	2120	Curatorial Practice	The course offers an introduction to the theoretical and practical knowledge on the curatorial process, exploring new alternative curatorial strategies that re-examine the role of the curator and the art institution. Using case studies, the course will look at current models in curatorial practice and the relationship of the curator with artists, the art market, and the public, both inside and outside traditional art institutions. Students will work on a collaborative project curating an art exhibition that may be realized virtually or inside a gallery space. Working in teams, students will become familiar with the different aspects of exhibition production from research to writing wall texts, to designing the exhibition, and its educational program.	0	0
68	68	ARTH-UH	2121J	Museums in a Global Context	This course surveys the history and social role of art museums, from their origins in cabinets of curiosity formed during the age of exploration to their global proliferation today. We will consider how Enlightenment collecting practices led to the development of the “universal museum” in an era of nationalism and colonial expansion, and examine how this dominant model has expanded and been challenged over the past century.  Among the issues to be discussed are: the organization and display of collections, the language and symbolism of museum architecture, heritage and repatriation, cultural diversity and the politics of representation, and globalized collecting and exhibiting today. Classroom lectures will be supplemented by talks by local specialists and field trips drawing on the rich diversity of museums in the London area.	0	0
69	69	ARTH-UH	2122J	Age of Warhol	In 2017, 30 years after his death, Andy Warhol was the most-shown artist in the world. At auction, he competes annually with European artists such as Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) or the Chinese painters Zhang Daqian (1899-1983) and Qi Baishi (1864-1957) in terms of overall profitability. In influence, he remains a force among contemporary artists. From his famous Campbell’s soup cans to his enduring aphorism that “In the future, everyone will be world-famous for fifteen minutes,” Warhol's art and thinking saturate contemporary culture. This seminar examines his 25-year career as a painter, filmmaker, writer and publisher, music producer, photographer, TV personality, collector, and artistic mentor and collaborator, as well as his legacy in what has been described as our brand-oriented “Warhol economy.” What can Warhol’s output and reception tell us about class, gender and sexuality, religion, media, and ideas about celebrity and self-hood over the last half-century? And how should we understand his role in global culture today?	0	0
70	70	ARTH-UH	2123	Museums, Art and Society	Countries in Western Asia, Southeast Asia and China are witnessing a significant rise in the number of art museums as part of their urban regeneration. Focusing on examples from these regions, the course will examine the changing role and function of art museums in the 21st century offering a theoretical and practical understanding of the current discourse on contemporary art, social practice and the community.  Students will meet with curators and administrators at art museums, galleries and alternative art spaces to analyze how art exhibitions and museum acquisitions are shaping art history and the relationships between the art institution and society.  Class will gain an understanding of the forces that are shaping the UAE art history and its nascent art ecosystem.	0	0
71	71	ARTH-UH	2124	Art of the Sixties	The 1960s experienced the emergence of new approaches to the making of art, while the art world became international to an unprecedented degree. Pop art and Minimal art used painting and sculpture as a means to confront contemporary culture with itself. In Fluxus, Video art and Performance artists found ways to involve the viewer. Earth art and Conceptual art were stretching the traditional boundaries of art in order to find a new grounding, while other artists experimented with sound, light, and movement in a way that led to a crossing of boundaries between dance, sculpture, music, and theater. All this happened in many places at the same time. The course will consider in detail many individual works of art while at the same time pursuing a comparative approach to the various outcomes of the new aesthetics. It will make it clear that the art of the 1960s is foundational for almost all further developments of art.	0	0
72	72	ARTH-UH	2125	Art of the 1970s and 80s: Postminimalism to Postmodernism & Beyond	The 1970s and 80s saw a number of significant shifts in the art world and new approaches to art making. Some of the most radical outcomes of art movements of the 1960s only emerged in the 1970s and 1980s with so-called “institutional critique”, whereas a strong resistance to exactly this genealogy made itself felt in a wave of neo-expressionist painting (Arte Cifra, Neue Wilde, figuration libre, Transavantguardia, New Image Painting). This was countered by the “picture generation” whose image production was based on photography and related to discussions of “postmodernism” and of “appropriation”. Female artists gained in stature to a previously unprecedented degree (especially in video and photography) and made gender-issues and relations of power a major theme in art. It became clear at the same time that the phase of the dominance of American art after World War II was over. This lead to a more widespread and diverse circulation of ideas. The course is based on a comparative approach, highlighting commonalities as well as differences between various artistic endeavors.	0	0
73	73	ARTH-UH	2126	Japanese Art: Currents of Influence and Transformation	This course explores the transformative process of cross-cultural inspiration in art traditions by examining Japanese art from two perspectives: its absorption of influence and its stimulation of influence. We will investigate cross-cultural influence by following two directional currents over time: Eastward from China, Korea, Portugal and Holland to Japan; then Westward from Japan to Europe and America. We will explore what artists admired in newly introduced works of art, what they choose to integrate into their own practices and how this impacted their work. We will gain insight into the transformative effect of outside influence on indigenous art traditions; of how artists in Japan, Europe and America did not merely ‘copy’ what inspired them, but how they internalized new ideas to create something original, even revolutionary, within their own art traditions.	0	0
74	74	ARTH-UH	2127JX	Orientalism and the Discovery of Islamic Architecture	The Course examines a very rich tradition in art and architecture that was inspired by the long interaction between the “West” and the “Orient” (mainly the Islamic Middle East), which we call Orientalism.  Students will learn about the entire orientalist discursive tradition from antiquity to the present as the historical background of the artistic production that has the same name.  They will also be introduced to orientalist painting, architecture, interior design, photography, and contemporary art as creative and representational facets of the West’s engagement with the Orient from the Enlightenment to the present (18-21 century).  They will review texts, images, objects, and buildings, which have been influential in shaping the Western representations of the Islamic Orient as well as informing modern Islamic artistic and architectural self-representations.  Through this review, students will acquire an awareness of the complexities of culturally molded artistic representation not only of the Orient but also in general, which always defy and sometimes subvert the identities that purport to imagine and produce them.  The course will also strive to teach students how to be critical; how to spot and analyze arguments in texts, images, and designs and examine their inner logic, assumptions, and conclusions; how to build a knowledge base from research and reading to develop their own arguments for their written assignments or graphic presentations; and how to present their arguments in public and debate their ideas in an academic setting.  The student will also learn to consider how the orientalist tradition still impacts the ways the art and architecture of the Islamic world are designed and viewed today.  PLEASE NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.  This course includes a required international trip to Spain.	0	0
75	75	ARTH-UH	2128	Money and Art in the Global Renaissance	This course situates artistic production in the late middle ages and early modern period in the maritime cultures of Indian and Atlantic Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. Informed by approaches from art history, history, economics, and anthropology, it examines the role of cross-cultural exchange, banking, trade, finance, collecting, and patronage in shaping artistic production. Secondly, it explores in turn the ways in which works of art played a role in the evolution of commercial and political culture of the period. It will begin with an examination of the recent scholarship on the connectedness of the early modern world and the formulation of Global Renaissance. While looking from the perspective of Europe and the Islamic world, it will pay particular attention to interactions between the latter and Italy.	0	0
76	76	ARTH-UH	2129	Deciphering Japanese Design	This course delves into the fundamentals of Japanese design—both traditional, applied arts and modern/contemporary design—by exploring the distinctive principles, concepts, theories, philosophies, aesthetics, sensibilities, practices and meanings. It offers a means of deciphering the often subtle and nuanced interests, intentions, perceptions and sensory experiences elicited through Japanese design. Our investigation into the obtuse realm of ancient aesthetics—mu,  ma, yûgen, shibui, wabi, sabi, kizen, mitate, hana, etc., which arises from deep awareness of the sacred, nature, beauty, time, form, space, emptiness, etc.—will lead to an understanding of the inherent, intangible cultural properties and values that continue to inform the best of contemporary Japanese design. By studying diverse works across the disciplines of architecture, interior design, product design, graphic design, fashion design, book binding, metalwork, lacquerware, textiles, ceramics, basketry, paper making, tea ceremony, gardening and culinary arts, students will gain insight into the multifaceted, integral, processes of Japanese design, spanning conceptualization, production, appreciation and use. We will ask what constitutes, generates, and advances Japanese design. What accounts for its sustenance, coherency, uniqueness and exceptional achievements?	0	0
77	77	ARTH-UH	2610	Global Renaissance	What does it mean to make Renaissance art history global? This interdisciplinary seminar will study the masterpieces and material culture produced during Europe’s first sustained overseas contact with the rest of the world in the early modern period (16th-18th centuries). Looking closely at the new categories and new geographies of objects fostered by the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British maritime trade routes, this course will reconsider traditional approaches to art history and weigh the new methods and revisions these curious images suggest. Objects will be studied from the perspectives of how they conceptualized “world,” how histories of exploration and collecting intersected, how personal and communal identities were manufactured, and how political diplomacy and subversion impacted them and in turn were affected. Serious attention will be devoted to honing the craft of researching and writing a major research paper, step by step, in preparation for a capstone thesis in the humanities.	0	0
78	78	ARTH-UH	2810	Silk Roads, Sea Routes and Shared Heritage	This course will explore the dynamics of artistic production along the exchange routes often referred to as the Silk Roads and related Sea Routes, stretching from China to the Mediterranean, and beyond. Through the examination of key case studies, this course will investigate exchanges ranging from the 1st to the 18th century within Asia and Europe, as well as the Americas. A special focus will be on the role of artists, traders and travelers in the Islamic world as dynamic innovators and active intermediaries within these exchanges. We will discuss the transmission of new technologies along these routes, and witness the resulting shifts in artistic production in areas such as painting, papermaking, weaving and ceramics. We will make use of textual, archaeological, and art historical sources from across this vast region to illuminate the effects of these long histories of contact.	0	0
79	79	ARTH-UH	3010	Thinking Art	This course offers engagements with the problems and methods of Art History at an advanced level. It examines in detail works of art that reflect upon tradition, aesthetic experience and art practice in complex ways and does so by situating these examinations in rich historical and theoretical frameworks. The course is open to anyone who has completed either Foundations of Art History I or II and at least one Art History elective but it is designed especially with Art History juniors in mind because the course is, in part, a useful preparation for Capstone work in the senior year. The course is a requirement for all students pursuing the Art History track.	0	0
80	80	ARTH-UH	4000	Art History Capstone Seminar	The capstone experience in Art History provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, Art History students will refine a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and undertake research and/or creative work.

103	103	BUSOR-UH	1001J	Principles of Marketing	The purpose of this course is to introduce the concepts and activities that constitute the field of marketing, and to develop an understanding its role in the economy and the modern corporation. We will also devote substantial attention to marketing in multi-cultural and global environments.  Our emphasis is on making practical decisions and developing techniques and perspectives that will be useful to the business professional. Towards this end, we will analyze a number of cases covering a broad range of industries, products, and markets.  In this course we assume that the goal of the marketing professional is to make decisions that maximize the long run, risk adjusted value of the firm. That is, we seek to commit limited firm resources to the best long run strategic alternatives.  The focus is on building businesses that serve buyer needs and wants while meetings appropriate standards of investment return and sustainability.  Also, in this course, we explicitly recognize that firms are held to ethical and legal standards by various jurisdictional powers and stakeholders and that, in global civil society, the values embedded in a brand (especially respect for labor rights a commitment to environmental sustainability) often constitute a major portion of the differentiated market value of the brand.   This course is a collaborative effort between the students and the instructor. Together we will examine, judge, and debate the theoretical underpinnings of marketing; we will also, through case analysis, construct and critique arguments supporting specific marketing decisions.	0	0
104	104	BUSOR-UH	1003	Management & Organizations	Why do some organizations succeed while others flounder?

The better that you understand these issues, the more effective you will be in your future careers.	0	0
105	105	BUSOR-UH	1004	Strategic Management	This course provides an introduction to strategic management. The course has two broad goals. A first is to understand why some companies are financially much more successful than others. The second is to analyze how managers can devise a set of actions (“the strategy”) and design processes that allow their company to obtain a financial advantage. To gain a better understanding of strategic issues and begin to master the analytic tools that strategists use, students study the strategic decisions of companies in many different industries and countries and learn from tools utilized by business researchers.	0	0
106	106	BUSOR-UH	1005J	Language of Business	Imagine the awesome power and influence you’d have if you knew the precise words, visuals and video that had the greatest impact on the greatest number of people.  You could change the way they think, the way they interact, even how they behave.   That is the purpose of this course: using case-studies to teach students how to identify and apply the most effective business language and communication techniques in real-world settings.  Comparatively little focus has been directed towards the development of business language and the role of messaging in the corporate world.  Because this is a J-Term class, the emphasis will be less on scholarly texts and more on the fundamentals of public communication in the real world, with a focus on what works, what doesn’t, and why.	0	0
107	107	BUSOR-UH	1006J	Cross-Cultural Negotiation	This course will highlight the components of effective negotiations across cultures and provide you with a framework to analyze your own behavior in cross cultural negotiations.

109	109	BUSOR-UH	1009	Ethics, Technology, and Business	This course examines the ethical issues that arise in the context of the rapid development of technology, medical science, and the increasing power of business corporations. In recent years, scientific progress has allowed us to achieve many things, including the cure of fatal diseases and the creation of intelligent machines that can surpass human capabilities. Yet, for all these benefits, the development of science and technology has spawned a host of problems such as: conflict between individual rights and social welfare; clash between respect for personal autonomy and expertise; automation and unemployment; and the replication of human bias by algorithms. Along with scientific progress, the social role of businesses and corporations are also becoming increasingly important. How should corporations, for example, balance the pursuit of profit with respect for employees’ rights and liberties? Should the state refuse to enforce unconscionable contracts, even when enforcing those contracts would make both parties better off? What is the social role of corporations in the context of increasing inequality?	0	0
110	110	BUSOR-UH	1501	Introduction to Accounting	This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of financial accounting and focuses on the development, analysis and use of financial reports.

Students read, listen to music, learn the rudiments of drumming, use computer software to analyze and generate rhythms, solve puzzles of musical time patterns, and write on various topics. They complete an individual research project that showcases the application of knowledge in their selected discipline or culture to an open question concerned with rhythm. They discuss progress on their projects during the term and present their results to the class at the end of term. No computer programming experience or musical training is required.	0	0
115	115	CADT-UH	1005	Creativity and Innovation	Is creativity a gift or a skill? Can creativity be learned? Because creativity is deeply personal, this course will address these questions through individual and collective experiences. The heart of this course is the Personal Creativity Project – an opportunity for students to practice creativity by designing and executing a project of their choice. The project may be on any topic, from art and music to computer programs and business model development. The project will be complemented by reading assignments (completed prior to class), class discussions, and one-on-one meetings with the instructor. Students will leave the course with a completed project and a personal philosophy of creativity, based on the fusion of readings, study, discussion, and experience. The course provides a great deal of freedom for learning and does not provide step-by-step instructions. As a result, the successful completion of this course will require a significant amount of self-motivation.	0	0
116	116	CADT-UH	1006J	Nomads	What can the unique human ecology and worldview that emerges from mobile ways of life teach us about human ingenuity and culture? This course uses the lenses of philosophy, art, and design to examine the history, influence, and cultural underpinnings of nomadism and nomadic dwelling. Paying special attention to kinetic objects and the built environment, students will probe historical and contemporary conceptions of ownership and ecology, transience and permanence, home and homelessness, and citizenship and belonging. All aspects of mobile dwellings, from familiar vernacular models such as tents and huts to developments in humanitarian design and contemporary art, will be considered. Students will be presented with a series of design challenges and will be asked to solve problems by creating new designs and producing prototypes. No previous background or training in design is required.	0	0
117	117	CADT-UH	1007	Wood	Wood is inseparably linked to human history and culture. From mankind’s earliest use of sticks for shelter, warmth, and gathering food, the increasingly complex ways that we have used and understood this material reflect the history of civilization itself. What can wood can teach us about ecology, human history, ingenuity, and culture? By examining wood’s role across several diverse cultures, this class will consider our ever-evolving relationship to wood through its use in architecture, art, and design. We will study the work of artists and designers including Richard Deacon, Giuseppe Penone, and Ai Weiwei, and will also examine the lore and mythology of wood through literary works like the Epic of Gilgamesh and the enchanted forests of the Brothers Grimm. The class includes a practical studio component in which students learn historic and contemporary woodworking techniques, respond to carpentry design challenges, and develop a kinesthetic knowledge and materials understanding through the exploration and manipulation of wood and wood-based materials. No previous background or training is required.	0	0
118	118	CADT-UH	1008Q	Touch	It is easy to have an idea of the effects of significant loss of vision or hearing by closing our eyes or by wearing earplugs. What about a significant loss of the sense of touch? The answer might not come readily due in part to the subtle, effortless function of this sense. Far from being just an immediate skin sensation, touching is intimately blended into embodied experiences that are affectionate, expressive, personal, and interpersonal. The haptic modality is our fundamental mode of access to the physical world. This course provides a multidisciplinary, cross-cultural introduction to the dynamics and salience of the human sense of touch and traces a continuous thread through a number of fundamental questions and critical approaches related to human haptics. A variety of interpretations, disciplines, and experiences exploring the symbolic, cultural, ethical, social, and technical aspects of touch will be discussed. Topics include social and cultural development, memory, learning, digital design, tactile therapies, human computer interaction, multimodal interaction and sensory substitution, and privacy and security.	0	0
119	119	CADT-UH	1009	Light	(Formerly COREA-AD 58J)From its physical properties that create life to its metaphorical association with beauty and goodness, light is integral to our experience of being human. Playing out over the millennia, from the Chinese tradition of the Lantern Festival at the Lunar New Year to the current production and manufacture of LED components, our relationship with light has played a significant role culturally and materially in our understanding of the world around us. This course will examine the perceptual, psychological, and metaphorical ways in which we encounter light in stories, art, and culture. Materials include texts from a variety of cultures that use light and darkness as a metaphor for good and evil, as well as the works of artists such as James Turrell, Anthony McCall, Teddy Lo, and Erwin Redl, who all work directly with light. Celebrations, rituals, and ceremonial use of light like the Diwali and the growth and use of pyrotechnics will be considered.	0	0
120	120	CADT-UH	1010	From Vision to Visual	How does one “visualize” vision? Today, scientists are required to be well versed in visualizing their data due to the increasing demand to encapsulate research data in imagery or short videos. This course examines the scientific tools developed to study the visual system and highlights the visualization methods that are now integral in communicating scientific research. Students learn about the visual techniques used to paint cellular life. They address questions about visual perception: How do retinal cells detect and respond to signals in the external environment? What cues activate the photo transduction cascade? And what is the neuronal circuitry that connects the retina to the brain? In a final project, students are asked to “record” data and present it as a visual narrative.	0	0
121	121	CADT-UH	1011	Words	Words, words, words. Words are the basic units of language, but how do they help us communicate our thoughts? How are they internally constructed? And how do they come together to form complex meanings? How are words from different languages similar, and how are they different? Do words reflect or shape our thought? Do they expand or constrain our imagination? This interdisciplinary course explores what words are and how we think of them. The course brings together insights and ideas from a number of fields: linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, computer science, history, literature, religion, and visual arts to help answer these questions. Students will read materials from a variety of books and articles and discuss them in class, and they will engage in solving and creating language puzzles as they learn how to analyze words in terms of their form, function, and meaning in context. Term projects can range from collection and analysis of linguistic data to multidisciplinary artistic creations.	0	0
122	122	CADT-UH	1012	Laughter	Laughter is an essential part of the human experience. Why do we laugh, and what does it mean? How does laughter function within us as individuals, in our local circles, and as a global community? What evokes laughter that transcends culture, and what is culturally specific? In this course students will confront laughter and its capacity to disarm, connect, heal, teach, debunk, humiliate, reform, confront, expose, progress, politicize, humanize, and empower. The course readings will include literature, visual art, theater, film, television, animation, new media, psychology, and biology. Students will encounter such artists, writers, and thinkers as Nasreddin Hoca, Aristophanes, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Margaret Cho, Jim Henson, Frida Kahlo, Oscar Wilde, Jane Austen, Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov, Joss Whedon, Tina Fey, and Takashi Murakami.	0	0
123	123	CADT-UH	1013EQ	Language of Computers	This course introduces students to the basics of how computers “think” and some of the inherent limitations of computers. How do programs (software applications) make computers behave intelligently and allow them to solve problems effectively for a wide range of applications and fields, from art and other media to education, medicine, and the core sciences? How do we use computer programs to process, structure, and manage information, create and manipulate digital media, and search and gather information relevant to any particular topic? How do computer programs operate virtually, creating the World Wide Web of the modern digital age, and how does all of this affect issues related to security and privacy in the wired world we live in today? Students are asked to create innovative programming solutions to a set of problems and develop applications focused on the social good for their final project. The programming language of choice is Python, a relatively easy programming language with powerful visual, text processing, and graphics capabilities. No prior programming experience is required.	0	0
124	124	CADT-UH	1014EJQ	Heuristics	Many problems in science, business, and politics require heuristics—problem solving techniques that often work well but give imperfect guarantees. This course teaches heuristics as they apply to the design of scientific experiments, the resolution of economic or political negotiations, and in the construction of engineering devices in hostile environments. Students will work in small teams that will solve puzzles, conduct cross-cultural experiments, and build protocols for a competitive auction game. Students will use and learn computational tools, but the course has no programming prerequisite. The intent is to make you better able to face complex problems in any field you choose.	0	0
125	125	CADT-UH	1015J	Explorable Stories	The fundamental building blocks of good storytelling have remained consistent throughout history. What constantly changes though are the technologies—including tools, mediums, and platforms—through which stories are communicated. This class uses today’s dominant mode of communication, the World Wide Web, to create and share stories that are engaging, interactive, and “explorable.” Combining traditional writing skills with modern web javascript libraries and other multi-media tools, students will learn how to write, design, and code their own 21st-century digital stories. These may take a variety of forms, including creative fiction, journalistic non-fiction, educational lessons, or personalized accounts. The goal will be for students iteratively to produce their own compelling, explorable pieces that live on the web and can be shared universally. Some web development or coding experience is preferable but not required.	0	0
126	126	CADT-UH	1016	Utilitas, Venustas, Firmitas	Design seems to be omnipresent, but what is it?

127	127	CADT-UH	1017J	Re-Performing Death	This class investigates death’s circumstances and aftermath by way of “re-performance”: ritualized explorations of myth, poetics, imagery, and emotion that lead to a rich understanding and celebration of being alive. Spanning millennia, continents, and cultures, the course considers science, imagination, instinct, fear, love, and faith as driving forces in understanding death. From ancient texts like The Tibetan Book of The Dead, The Gospel of Matthew, and The Egyptian Book of the Dead the course will turn to a range of modern poetics, including literature, music, film, visual art, and performance from Norman Mailer, Sarah Kane, Laurie Anderson, Diamanda Galás, David Bowie, The Smiths, Arca, Joy Division, Jodorowsky, David Lynch, Akira Kurosawa, Matthew Barney, Kiki Smith, Ai Weiwei, Bill Viola, Ron Athey, Marina Abramovic, and Yoko Ono. Traveling to Japan, the course brings these artists into conversation with Japanese re-performances of death in Shinto Ritual, Noh, Kabuki, and Bunraku, as well as Butoh, anime, and video gaming as students produce creative writing, visual arts, performance, and photography.	0	0
128	128	CADT-UH	1018	Digital Curation	This course asks what it means to be a curator of content online: What is an author? a collection? What are ways we made collections before the digital age? Who is our audience? Examining popular forms of curation, from historical examples to social media (Snapchat, Tumblr, playlists), students examine trends in digitization and open cultural data as they explore what makes a digital object and what constitutes a web-based collection. Surveying a variety of open-content management systems used in the museum and academic sector, students will use, and critique, a common technology for academic curation—omeka.org and neatline.org—and will reflect on digital citizenship through their own social media practices. Students are encouraged to be creative, co-creating new content, remixing, and building upon the “vast and growing digital creative commons.” The course is useful for any student interested in information sciences, content creation, and the GLAM sector (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) but is open to all. Student work includes open, reflective blog writing about curation and web-based exhibits in student web hosting.	0	0
129	129	CADT-UH	1019	Lies and Lying	Lying is an integral part of human communication. It is only in contrast to lies that we are able to construct the concept of truth and “choose” our perception of reality. From white lies and exaggerations to advanced techniques of persuasion such as propaganda and brainwashing, this course will examine the psychological, philosophical, ethical and social aspects of several contexts in which lying commonly occurs: art, culture, literature, science, politics, advertising, journalism, relationships, the digital world, and history. We will discuss and analyze the motives, techniques, technology, and outcomes of some of the biggest lies and liars throughout history, from mythological gods in ancient Greece through fake alchemists in the Islamic Golden Age to contemporary schemers. Students will examine lying in texts, films, biographies, cartography, visual arts, the internet, social networking, mass media, and advertisements and learn from guest liars and lying experts.	0	0
130	130	CADT-UH	1020	Wayfinding: Graphic Design in the Built Environment	In November 2014, Volvo Race’s boat Vestas did not find her way to Abu Dhabi port and got stranded on a reef in the Indian Ocean instead. What went wrong? Is it still possible to get lost today, in the age of ubiquitous and democratized GPS? What does it mean to find one’s way? How do different environments create unique problems, as well as provide solutions? How do we find those solutions ourselves, and how can we intervene in the design of our working and living environments, in the design of our navigational practices, in order to avoid getting lost? What tools do we have? How do they work? What can we learn from navigation before GPS? Informed by new technologies, the demand for sustainability, and the inputs from cognitive studies, “wayfinding” has grown to become a field of research in its own right, related to both architecture and design. It studies the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization of sensory cues from the external environment. The course explores visual design components and theoretical ramifications and will include workshops on campus signage systems, with a focus on accessible design.	0	0
131	131	CADT-UH	1021	Art of Narrative Science	Are art and science really in conflict with each other, as is often thought? Is science dispelling mystery and consigning us to a world of dreary reductionism? This course answers such questions with a resounding no. There is, in fact, neither conflict nor antagonism between the realms of art and science. Indeed, the two complement and complete one another in ways that only artful narrative can fully reveal. A poet, through metaphor, builds bridges from entangled inscapes of thought and emotion to a place of shared understanding. A good narrative science writer must do the equivalent with the often recondite minutia of modern scientific exploration. It has become ever more essential for writers to report back from these new and wild frontiers with clear, intelligible, and descriptive prose. Students in this course will develop their vocabularies of both science and writing, learning to seize upon the parallels between the writing process and sound scientific method: trial, error, repetition, and, perhaps most importantly, daring.	0	0
132	132	CADT-UH	1022	Vision	This seminar concerns the phenomenon of vision. The sense of vision is closely related to processes of understanding, thought, and linguistic interpretation. Seeing is an activity in which the eye and brain work together, and hence it raises questions about theories of consciousness. Students will approach these questions on the basis of texts, cinematic materials, and experiments we conduct ourselves. Classic treatments by authors such as Charles Baudelaire and Maurice Merleau-Ponty will be examined alongside more recent theoretical approaches by Serge Daney, for example, or the connection of image and language in Hollis Frampton’s film Nostalgia, which suggests that vision relies on an aspect of imagining, since what we see and how we see are determined by memories and expectations. If vision can be connected to imaginations—that is, an extension of what has actually been seen—is this just the flip-side of the fact that our vision operates very selectively? If so, how do our visual perceptions relate to the visual perception of others?	0	0
133	133	CADT-UH	1024	What Is Music?	This course analyzes what we understand as “music.” Drawing on music of different styles from all over the world, seminar members will explore what constitutes musical meaning, how it is produced, and how music expresses feelings. Taking advantage of the multicultural nature of NYUAD, students will explore the cultural and universal mechanisms at play when we listen to and understand music. A lab portion of the class guides students through basic musical elements such as notation systems, scales, and simple compositional techniques.	0	0
134	134	CADT-UH	1025	Re-Design	Giorgio Vasari defined Mannerism in terms still used today in Art History: in the wake of the Renaissance masters, copying became the standard way to learn. But what do we really learn by copying? Would a contemporary mannerism fit in today’s world, dominated by visual information? How then does creativity work? How does change happen? Why did we wait half a century before having personal computers in colors other than beige? Why do we seem oblivious to the manufactured filters mediating our observation of nature itself? What are the trade-offs when we delegate creative choices to Google’s algorithms? What separates the artists of the past and the brand consultants of today? This course addresses the role and limits of copying as students explore many facets of graphic design, visual communication, and artistic value. The vibrant visual culture-in-the-making of Abu Dhabi and the UAE provide an ideal background for such explorations. Students will elaborate on the tension (real or perceived) among today’s artists, designers, and scientists, while discussing why a multidisciplinary mind is fundamental for contemporary attempts to re-design the world around us.	0	0
135	135	CADT-UH	1026	Human Value	What is the value of human life? How is human value socially constructed in particular political, economic, and cultural contexts? When one society honors athletes and movie stars more than factory laborers, does that mean people with fame, wealth, and beauty are inherently more valuable? How do individuals create value and meaning in their lives in different contexts? This class will deconstruct the historical definition of human value across a variety of cultures, from foragers to contemporary global capitalist society. We will examine human value in terms of such themes as worth, utility, beauty, status, wealth, and fulfillment, via close engagement with texts, visual arts, mass media, and advertising. A practical component of the class will challenge students to explore concepts surrounding human value through a variety of artistic media, from sketching to sound recording and photography. No previous background or training is required.	0	0
136	136	CADT-UH	1027	Questioning and Writing the Self: Memoir and Anti-memoir	Is writing a life possible and what does it mean to try? What do we learn about notions of self and society, culture and change, as well as art and literature through the window of memoir? Many traditions celebrate the individual voice, singular stories, and remarkable people, yet there are also examples of “life writing” that express skepticism and anxiety around ideas of the individual as remarkable, distinct from the collective, and particularly entitled to tell their story. We will read texts across eras, cultures, ethnicities, and genders that raise questions about the self and the collective, writing and memory, and about writing the remarkable as well as the everyday.	0	0
137	137	CADT-UH	1028J	Human Voice	This course explores the complexity, strangeness, socio-historical resonance, and expressive power of the human voice, as well as a number of the factors that condition and delimit that power. We begin by discussing the voice’s relationship to the body (both in terms of anatomy and contemporary discourse on “embodiment”) and to a number of technologies, from amplification to autotune. In the second half of the course, we focus in on the salience of voice within the experimental music scene in New York. Perhaps most importantly, we treat our class as an experimental vocal collective, composing and performing together throughout the term. No prior musical experience is necessary, but a willingness to make vocal sounds in public is required.	0	0
138	138	CADT-UH	1029	Inspiration, Art, and the Examined Life	Has a book ever knocked you out? Has a story stuck with you for years? Has an image stopped you cold? Are you changed by these encounters? This course explores, examines, and activates the elusive and subjective motor for creative work. It begins with material that has directly impacted the professor’s life and work as a theater artist. Later, students will share igniting materials from their own experiences. The aim: to incite the imagination, culminating in an original work. Where do you turn for inspiration? Can you engage your fears in pursuit of your goals? How do you flip your script to make progress? Departure points include artists, writers, filmmakers, thinkers, and theater makers such as Judith Malina, Allen Ginsberg, Art Spiegelman, Francis Bacon, Edmund White, Anne Carson, David Markson, Italo Calvino, Pedro Almodovar, Jean Genet, Andy Goldsworthy, Banksy, CG Jung, Franz Fanon, Aimé Césaire, Patricia Peters, theoretical physicists, Black Lives Matter, and even occasional recipes. When it comes to inspiration, can a good meal change everything?	0	0
139	139	CADT-UH	1031J	How Movement Makes Meaning: Dramaturgy, Dance, and the Development of Trajal Harrell’s O Medea	Dramaturgy, Dance, and the Development of Trajal Harrell’s O Medea:   This intensive class on dramaturgy and dance takes Trajal Harrell’s residency at the NYUAD Arts Center as an opportunity for project-based learning. We will engage with Trajal Harrell and his company of dancers as he makes a performance that alludes to specific dance genres -- voguing and butoh -- and uses them as theoretical lenses for a new choreographic work that intersects with Sophocles’ drama Medea. The rehearsal studio will serve as our classroom to improvise upon and explore a series of questions about life and art, and politics and performance, through reading, dancing, and writing. In those studio sessions, we will develop a somatic practice that embodies gestures and choreographies that could be read as both cultural exchange and cultural appropriation. We will study and employ the techniques of dance dramaturgy to investigate how these movements and choreographies create and redistribute cultural meaning through bodies in motion. Both the class readings and the daily studio practice sessions offer a vocabulary and concepts that privilege the role of contemporary dance in global culture. And at the end of the session, each participant will make an artist book that reflects upon the experience of the J-term session.  To that end, we will study these topics through the methods of a dance dramaturg, who dance scholar Katherine Profeta defines as a collaborator that “oscillates between theory and practice, inside and outside, word and movement, question and answer.” Be prepared to think, to move, and to write.	0	0
140	140	CADT-UH	1032	Documenting Identity	What is the relationship between documents and identity? Do documents record, create, influence, mask, and/or shift identity? The course considers different types of identities (immigrant, criminal, racial, gender, normative, artistic) and documents (police records, personal and state archives, art objects). The course tracks the dynamic relationships among documents and identities through time and across cultures. We will study the history behind the creation and development of documents such as the passport or mug shot and weigh in on contemporary debates around racial profiling and immigration bans. At the same time, we will also study a diverse range of artistic attempts at documenting identity in print and visual media. For the final project each student will produce both an artistic project and a reflective essay that engage the intersections of documents and identity.	0	0
141	141	CADT-UH	1033	Bioinspiration	In the 3.8 billion years since life began on Earth, nature has evolved. Inspired by this process, humans have replicated key design features to develop novel materials, devices, and structures in fields such as the arts, design, engineering, and the social sciences by replicating key design principles and features. This course asks how biology has inspired human design and thinking across different cultures and fields. Students will examine various examples in engineering, art, architecture, music, and social science to discuss how the human capacity for analogical reasoning has enabled the transfer of properties, mechanisms, and ideas from biology to design principles such as shape, surface, structure, making, information-processing, and social behavior. Using bio-inspired products such as gecko tape, Velcro, self-cleaning surfaces, and neuromorphic chips for inspiration, students will develop their own designs to address some of the 21st century’s most pressing issues, such as energy, water, environment, food, and health.	0	0
142	142	CADT-UH	1034	Citizen Writer	It’s said the pen is mightier than the sword, and this course will help you develop the skills needed to make that true. In a world where we all recognize problems that need to be fixed, being able to write effectively, creatively, and persuasively can equip you, in any profession, to be heard as a citizen concerned with matters of equality, justice, and civic discourse. Drawing from a multidisciplinary perspective, and focused on global issues rooted in local contexts, citizen writers will examine and practice multiple formats, study rhetoric to become confident debaters, and think strategically and contextually to engage via traditional or social media. The complexity of free speech, and its opportunities and restrictions in varied societies, will be debated to form a nuanced understanding of how it limits and empowers you. The class will also write a constitution for a utopia we imagine together, draft personal manifestos, craft editorials, create essays to help you understand opposing and challenging views, and make animated explainer videos on foundational civic issues.	0	0
143	143	CADT-UH	1037X	Machines in Islamic Civilization	Is automation a science or a tool? Muslim contributions in automation, overlooked in the history of science, were long regarded as means for caliphs and the rich to impress the masses. But Muslim engineers excelled in creating complex automated systems, using them as gifts to foreign leaders, as public attractions, or to augment religious ceremony such as daily calls to prayer. Mainly powered by kinetic energy, these automata drew on scholars’ deep knowledge of hydraulics and complex levers and included musical instruments, horologia, automated drinking fountains, and clocks that told time using complex audiovisual tools. This course draws on historical sources and foundational science to explore Muslim advancements in automation. What roles did translation play as Muslim scientists encountered and documented the work of previous scholars? What were the basic automatic systems they developed and how do they compare to current technologies? How did they draw on environmental resources to develop automated systems without the need for non-renewable energy? Students will address such questions as they explore implications for their own projects in design and engineering.	0	0
144	144	CADT-UH	1038	Autonomous and Social Robots	How do we feel about robots? With technological developments in capability,  performance, autonomy, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness, robots have arrived in everyday life. This course considers the history and ethics of human-robot interaction and explores unsolved hurdles we face as robots assume a ubiquitous presence in our lives. How are robots currently integrating into human-centered, civic industries such as education, heath, and smart cities? What roles might robots play in the future of these industries? What are the economic and labor implications associated with robotic integration? How will consumers respond to the increased use of robots in daily life? How have popular media representations over the last century influenced the way we experience these changes? Topics will also include the miniaturization of robots and their use in situations such as focused drug delivery within the human body, save-and-rescue missions, or military combat. Students will assemble and program several Lego Mindstorm robots capable of carrying prefabricated objects and will also assemble a small house.	0	0
145	145	CADT-UH	1039	The Photo Album	Photo albums are meaningful, unique creations. Infused with intangible memories, they tangibly show specific, select moments of the past—some mundane, others poignant. Highly personal, photo albums also reveal shared encounters and assert human universals. How and by what means do our personal photo albums thus compile collective identities and histories? What stories lie behind their making? What narratives arise—formulaic or unexpected—when related or disparate photographs are organized or randomly displayed in the unifying context of photo albums? This course employs art practice and theory to investigate the curation of vernacular photography in family photo albums. Looking at the global history and contemporary manifestations of these practices, and drawing on NYUAD’s Akkasah Center of Photography, it asks: What are the motivations, challenges, and implications of commissioning or taking, collecting, or curating photographs of one’s family or oneself? How do we approach such collections as viewers? Who makes, owns, and passes down albums—to whom, for whom, and why? Students will also create photo albums as a generative means of engaging in and understanding this practice.	0	0
146	146	CADT-UH	1040	Ethics of the Image	From its invention in 1839, photography has been heralded as objective. Few doubt the veracity of a photo-finish, an endoscopic medical image, a traffic camera’s violation report, or a surveillance shot of a crime scene. Photographs bear witness to the Mai Lai massacre, the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, the Sahel famine of the 1980s, and refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. Though most readily embrace such visual testimony, we might also cede Susan Sontag’s point that photos are a “species of rhetoric” that “simplify” and “create the illusion of consensus.” In what ways do a photographer’s choices of what to include and exclude suggest self-conscious framing from a specific vantage point? What ethical questions emerge from this tension between the medium’s supposed objectivity and the photographer’s admitted subjectivity? Students will explore ethical scenarios in photojournalism, travel photography, street photography, portraiture, and commercial photography as they confront questions about consent, privacy, representation, citizen responsibility, and propaganda. Coursework includes response papers, case study reports, photo-critiques, photography tasks, and photo essays.	0	0
147	147	CADT-UH	1042	Play	What does it mean to play? The word connotes, among other things, both recreation and performance. From the imaginative games of childhood to more structured settings (sport, theater, board and video games), play assists in our development as individuals. This course offers a practice-based laboratory for the study of play. Students will learn and play with the Six Viewpoints—an actor-training system developed by choreographer and educator Mary Overlie (b. 1946)—in order to explore relationships between play and performance from an experiential perspective. Each week the class will pair a Viewpoints practice with key texts from various disciplines, including work by Maurice Merleau-Ponty, D. W. Winnicott, Johan Huizinga, Gregory Bateson, and Hans-Georg Gadamer, among others. As students move beyond the performing arts to consider the role of play in human culture, we will extend our practice-based research outside the classroom by carrying out site-specific improvisations and invisible dances. Key topics explored will include the relationship between play and other fields of study including epistemology, perception, selfhood, fantasy, illusion, art, and spectatorship.	0	0
148	148	CADT-UH	1043	Mapping Urban Utopia	How might a utopian city be designed? This multidisciplinary class departs from students' experiences with urban living to imagine the city of the future as an ideal space of mobility, access, and inclusion. Exploring critical questions about everyday urban design and architecture, students will engage with theoretical concepts, practical tools, and experiences such as digital cartography, sound ecology, psychogeography, soundwalks, conceptual mapping, and critical tourism to create a unique urban prototype. Hands-on introductions to drawing, sculpture, video, and sound design will expose students to space- and time-based media for artistic expression. Readings will include material drawn from disciplines including art history and practice, urban studies, sound studies, sociology, ethics, and media studies. Participants become spatial design consumers and makers, learning to analyze, explore, manipulate, and self-consciously negotiate public relations through discussion, presentations, and assignments, including 2D and 3D projects.	0	0
149	149	CADT-UH	1044JX	Documenting Tradition, Documenting Change: Sensory Ethnographic Methods in Kerala	When societies invoke their past through art and religion, they often make profound statements about their future; thus our studies of heritage can also track social change. Such research into expressive culture invites experiments in multisensory data collection (e.g. video, sound, recipes), collaboration (e.g. with interlocutors, between disciplines), and presentation (e.g. image, text, interactive media, performance). This work can make visible otherwise imperceptible processes, from neglected histories to environmental destruction. Students conduct fieldwork in Kerala, India, where communities that have long synthesized global influences are now threatened by chronic flooding and rising sea levels. We engage: 1) material heritage linked to the UAE and beyond such as Kozhikode’s mosques; 2) spectacular rituals such as Theyyam; and 3) confrontations with climate change such as sustainability projects in Kochi’s arts scene. Before and after, we balance technical training with the ethics of ethnographic representation while building our own exhibition. Whether as prospective artists, social scientists, policymakers, or coders, students devise novel forms for sharing their research. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.  This course includes a required international trip to India.	0	0
150	150	CADT-UH	1045J	Plastic Fantastic	What would a world without plastic look like? How does the world look because of it? Plastic Fantastic looks critically at plastic’s ubiquity in global consumer cultures. Students will consider plastic’s predecessors and contemporary alternatives and engage with a range of topics, from the environmental politics of plastic debris in oceans, to the ethics and values of plastic surgery, to the proliferation of cheap plastic toys and fashion trends. Based on these discussions, and inspired by the original meaning of the Greek term plastikos (to grow, to form), the class will develop and create a product using recycled plastic waste in NYUAD’s Plastic Recycling Research Lab. In addition to the completed project, to be displayed in an exhibition at the January Term’s end, students will leave with a personal philosophy of Art, Design, and Technology as well as a sense of how mutually reinforcing and beneficiary a mix of these fields can be for future problem solving. Mandatory field-trips include visits to relevant industries (water, oil, waste, etc.), natural reserves, and landfill sites in the UAE and the Philippines (Manila).NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Philippines.	0	0
151	151	CADT-UH	1046J	Make Art Here	This course investigates and creates location-driven art using sites in the UAE and Oman as departure points. How does location provoke aesthetic? What about content? If a town is known for its leisurely pace, will the work made there reflect that? Regardless of where we are, do we carry previously experienced locations with us? How might the sound of the sea impact your writing? How might the nature of the landscape impact your staging of a performance? Students will create multiple works of art provoked by a variety of locations, including Suwaidi Pearl Farm and Qalat Dhaya Date Farm and Rest House in Ras Al Khaima, UAE; the harbor and surrounding locations in Muscat, Oman, and the Al Ain Palace Museum in Al Ain, UAE. Students are expected to be active participants in both their own projects and the work of their peers. Students will archive their process, drawing on the archive to create their works, essays and final showings. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Oman	0	0
152	152	CADT-UH	1047J	Hacking in Global Perspective: Creativity, Copyright, and Control	What is hacking? It upends elections, spurs innovation and invention, improves and endangers security, and is simultaneously encouraged and fought by the same companies, governments, and institutions. What unites these aspects? Hacking is an attitude to technology and a set of technical practices. In this class, we will study hacker creativity by looking at hacking various technologies as a creative pursuit and a source of innovation, through a mix of history and hands-on experiment. (This class assumes no prior technological knowledge or expertise; students who find this subject intimidating are encouraged to apply.) Students will learn about reverse engineering and hardware hacking, free and open source information, cryptography, security in theory and practice, hacker ethics, innovation and hacking, and social media manipulation. These studies will be applied to two major global questions: copyright and intellectual property, ownership, and access, and control over infrastructure, networks, and devices -- from Chinese shanzhai, to Brazilian programming language developers, from Silicon Valley to St. Petersburg.	0	0
153	153	CADT-UH	1048	Reinventing the Wheel	The wheel’s origins remain a mystery. Did it evolve in the Mesopotamian city of Uruk, humanity’s first urban society, around 3500-3375 BCE? Or did a Boleraz copper miner in the Carpathian Mountains, around 4000 BCE, invent a pair of wheels connected by an axle in order to move a heavy ore basket? Why, despite having the potter’s wheel and trade with Mesopotamia, did the Nile valley not use wheels until the pharaohs adopted war chariots around 1600 BCE? Why did the wheel, which came into use in 3 BCE, disappear in the Middle East a few centuries later, even though the arid climate kept roads clean for most of the year? Why was wheeled transport absent in pre-Columbian America, considering that ancient Mexicans had invented wheeled toys on axles? Did the wheel spread across regions as an idea or a technology? What can its historical evolution teach us about innovation and durability, about why some technologies adapt and others fail or are lost? Students will tackle such questions as they explore how the wheel’s applications were shaped by religion, war, social hierarchies, gender bias, economic efficiency, and the local terrain—all while developing projects of their own.	0	0
154	154	CCEA-UH	1000J	Idea of the Portrait	This course explores the ways in which the portrait has been used as a vehicle for artistic expression, for the construction of social identity, for self-examination, and for the representation of cultural difference. It examines many kinds of portraits and self-portraits in painting and photography from different times and cultures and encourages engagement with a range of major issues that include the nature of personhood, of private and public identities, and of art itself. The course draws upon the rich resources of London’s museums and galleries, especially the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria & Albert Museum, the British Museum, and the Queen’s Collection.	0	0
155	155	CCEA-UH	1001	Ritual and Play	Underlying performances of all kinds—theatre, dance, music, the performances of everyday life, sports, and popular entertainments—are ritual and play. These must be understood from multiple perspectives. In the course, we investigate roots of human ritual and play in animal behavior; human religious and social rituals; and children and adults at play. Examples include the Taziyeh of Shi’a Islam, the Ramlila of Hinduism, the Olympic Games, Noh Drama of Japan, American baseball, “deep” and “dark” play.	0	0
156	156	CCEA-UH	1002J	Narrative, Media, and Technology	Telling stories is a fundamental human activity, but the ways these stories are told depends upon the means in which they are created and transmitted.  This course examines the role of technologies ranging from print, cave painting, comics, animation, and film, to hypertext, social media, and viral video.  In addition to reading and viewing, the assignments will also include creative technological projects and excursions to the Museum of Moving Image, the Museum of Comics Art, and The Moth storytelling theater.	0	0
157	157	CCEA-UH	1003	Collecting	What motivates human beings to form collections? How do we select, order, preserve and display information and objects? And, what intellectual processes are involved in these activities? What does the content of these collections say about those who created them? And what kind of narratives can be traced within the display of these collections? This course surveys the phenomenon of collecting, focusing on key moments in its history, from antiquity up to contemporary times. The first section of the class explores collections of “thought,” that is, how knowledge has been stored, organized and retrieved—and some of the tools we have developed to do so—including mnemonic devices, writing, codices, libraries, information architecture, and digital technologies. The second section concerns physical objects and their collection, classification, organization, and display. Finally, the course turns to the work of modern and contemporary artists who incorporate concepts of assemblage and curation. In response to the readings and to the materials covered in class, students will conceive, create, describe and display a collection of their own making.	0	0
158	158	CCEA-UH	1004	Identity and Object	This course asks how objects from the past obtain meaning long after they were made, and how they have come to express the identity of communities, nations, and religions. We will consider fundamental questions of identity by assessing how objects become imbued with meaning. Who ascribes these objects meaning and why? How do we relate to objects designated to represent us? We will explore object biographies from a range of periods, regions and traditions. We will discuss objects representing contested national and global identities, such as the Cyrus Cylinder from Iraq and the Koh-i-noor diamond from India, as well as material that facilitates discussion of socially and culturally defined identities. In all of these examples politics plays a constant role. Through case studies of iconic objects from around the world, students will compare significance in the originating society with place and function today to better understand how, why, and by whom identity is constructed.	0	0
159	159	CCEA-UH	1005	Abjection	(Formerly COREA-AD 53)How do we build an identity? What is rejected or expelled from us? This fundamental aspect of the human condition underlies the notion of abjection: a detached, degraded state, or the act of causing it. The abject, renounced in oneself or cast out of society, takes various forms from the maternal body and the corpse to social minorities and refugees. It implies some trauma or taboo that disturbs the symbolic order of law and norms. This course asks how abjection occurs on many levels and also catalyzes new modes of life and community. We trace it in terms of love, beauty, horror, disgust, sexuality, labor, multiculturalism, terrorism, etc., and highlight today’s abjection that is generated in global systems and revealed through violence or catastrophe, yet also with positive potential. We explore film (Fassbinder, Sissako, Campion, Eastwood, Von Trier, Sono Shion), literature (Sophocles, Boccaccio, Kafka, Yi Sang), art and performance (Bosch, Goya, Bacon, Sherman, Zhu Yu), along with psychoanalysis, feminism, philosophy, aesthetics, and trans-historical material from myths and religions to rock music and cyber culture.	0	0
160	160	CCEA-UH	1006	Idea of the Garden	Gardens are as diverse as cultures, but the idea of the garden is common to various cultures through the ages and across continents. What do gardens tell us about the human condition? How do gardens relate to the individual and the idea of community? How do they reflect philosophical ideas? In which ways do the real and imagined interfere with each other? Is a garden a representation of nature or culture or both? How does a garden relate to spiritual needs and sensual experience (smell, sound, sight, tactile and kinesthetic bodily feeling)? How is the idea of the garden distinguished from but related to the notion of a natural landscape? We will look at Zen-gardens and rooftop gardens, monastic and palace gardens, sculpture and pleasure gardens, mythic gardens in various religious traditions. The course is conceived as neither a historical survey nor a typological compilation but chooses diverse examples and representations of gardens from various cultures and historical periods in order to explore the ways in which gardens reflect the human condition.	0	0
161	161	CCEA-UH	1007	Abstraction	The making of abstract visual forms is a near-universal human activity across time and cultures. Some of the earliest known cave art, dating back approximately 40,000 years, is abstract. The use of abstract forms in ornament and for symbolic communication is found at different periods of history and in different locations across the globe. And abstraction has become prominent in modern art all over the world. This course takes a comparative approach to abstraction and asks why human beings in different places and at different times have drawn and carved similar shapes, lines, and patterns. What are the meanings of these forms? Why have some cultures with long traditions of representational painting turned to abstraction? How have religious, political, and social contexts shaped this turn? What has been the role of abstraction in Islamic and other non-Western traditions and how have these traditions influenced Western art? Although the course will range widely historically and culturally, it will take the Middle East as one of its key areas of interest and will include visits to galleries, private collections, and selected centers for traditional arts in the UAE.	0	0
162	162	CCEA-UH	1008	Artists' Writing	This seminar explores artists’ writings across different cultures, with a primary emphasis on texts written since 1945. Whatever form an artist chooses for her/his writing (e.g. diary, essay, lecture, statement), we will approach the written text in relation to her/his art practice. Artists not only make art objects but also write because they feel they have something to say which nobody else (art critic or academic) would be able to express. This provokes key questions: Do artists have a special way of thinking? Can we learn from artists to interrelate experience and practical ambition as well as ways of thinking and writing? Artists’ writings provide a context for their work rather than an explanation. They open up new horizons for reflection on their works and on cultural situations. Reading texts from artists such as Lygia Clark, Yoshihara Jiro, and Agnes Martin, we will observe how linguistic form and intellectual structure interfere. These theoretical studies will be accompanied by a practical task: learning from artists’ writings and experimenting with students’ own approach to writing in relation to their fields of study.	0	0
163	163	CCEA-UH	1009	A Thousand and One Nights	This course focuses on questions of religious and cultural difference through the 1001 Nights and related texts. Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and “pagan” realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders. The reception of the Nights tales in Europe animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference piqued the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt, and Arabia. Their writings serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah’s Cosmopolitanism and Said’s Orientalism.	0	0
164	164	CCEA-UH	1010	Imagined Cities	This course examines the ways in which writers have responded to the social complexity of urban life and the difficult task of finding points of connection within the diversity of the city. How do writers narrate both the order and the disorder of urban space? What intellectual frameworks do they call upon to find meaning in unfamiliar settings? How do these assumptions shape what is seen and unseen within the city? And most importantly, what do these city texts reveal about the potential for building new forms of belonging and community within the urban environment? Readings will include philosophical works from ancient Greece, travel accounts of the medieval and early modern world, and fiction from writers such as Zola, Woolf, Mahfouz, Conrad, and Pamuk.	0	0
165	165	CCEA-UH	1011	Law and the Imagination	There is no life without law. Nature has its laws. Religions have theirs, societies theirs, families theirs. Business has its rules and contracts. How do people understand the laws that are as much a part of life as the weather? Literature—the work of the imagination—guides our great journey towards understanding. Writers dramatize the relations among law, justice, and freedom. Writers also show the effect of law on the fates, fortunes, and feelings of people. The course explores the power of literature to show us what the law is, what it should not be, and what it might be.	0	0
166	166	CCEA-UH	1012	Doubles and Masks	(Formerly COREP-AD 23)Among the more significant activities of human beings is that of giving shape to fears and desires through art. All cultures participate in this form of emotional exteriorization, including creating “doubles” and “masks” through myths, literature, and other media. Concentrating on doubles and masks in several different cultures, we will chart the meaning and impact of the archetypal masked figures of the commedia dell’arte in French and British theatre; the obsessive concern with the grotesque (the monstrous mask) in French romanticism and in Haitian magical realism; zombification, carnival figures, and ghostly doubles in Latin American, North American, and African cultural forms. Students will build a repertory of approaches to interpreting and uncovering the many layers of masking and doubling by reading in anthropology, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and literary theory.	0	0
167	167	CCEA-UH	1014	Money and the Good Life	This course examines a variety of cultural conceptions of money and wealth, and the ethical questions that money or wealth allows a writer to probe. Is the value of people measured by the value of their money, or are there other criteria for wealth? Is someone’s wealth possible without someone else’s poverty? How is human ambition rewarded or punished in the “pecuniary culture”? The course looks for answers to these and other questions in key works of literature, sociology, economics, and other fields, reading classical texts ranging from Aristophanes’ Plutus, Ihara Saikaku’s “A Dose of What the Doctor Never Orders,” and William Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, to Honoré de Balzac’s Père Goriot, Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, and F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Great Gatsby. Readings are supplemented by excerpts from works by Ibn Khaldun, Adam Smith, Thorstein Veblen, Max Weber, and Alfred Hirshman.	0	0
168	168	CCEA-UH	1015	Gender and Representation	This course understands gender as a social construct rather than as self-evident and immutable, and examines the ways in which constructions of gender shift across time and place. Some of the questions we will consider include the following: what does it mean to be “male” or “female,” “masculine” or “feminine,” and how do the meanings of such categories vary across historical periods and geographic locations? How do we understand gender in relation to other social differences such as race, class, sexuality, religion, nationality, and disability? How have ideologies of gender been central to colonial and nationalist projects from the nineteenth century to the present? How does gender shift in the context of diaspora, migration, and globalization? Students will approach these questions through a consideration of aesthetic practices and representational forms from many periods and cultures—literature, film, visual art—that suggest alternatives to a binary logic of gender and instead articulate different visions of gender justice.	0	0
169	169	CCEA-UH	1016	Crime	Is a fascination with crime universal or does it vary over time and across cultures? Why do humans feel compelled to tell, retell, edit, and contest stories about their darkest doings? What is more revealing of a society’s values, the stories of its exemplary leaders, saints, and heroes, or the stories of its criminals and outcasts? What does the way a society judges and treats its criminals tell us about that society? For example, what does the death sentence passed on Socrates tell us about classical Athens? How does Plato create a foundational myth of Western philosophy out of this criminal sentence? The intersections of literature, film, and policing have shaped the emergence and development of key concepts such as identity, identification, subject, writing, evidence, authorship, and authority. Students will investigate these terms together with the ways crime and the criminal have been defined through time and in different cultures, using the lenses of literature, film, and visual culture in works by Plato, Dostoyevsky, Poe, Conan Doyle, Kafka, Lu Xun, Borges, Nabokov, Herta Müller, Kurosawa, Godard, and Kiarostami, among others.	0	0
170	170	CCEA-UH	1017	On Violence	The ethics of violence, its articulation and resistance, violence as a social problem and violence as social necessity: from the epic, to the novel, to contemporary poetry, literature has attempted to reckon with the question of violence. This includes violence in the form of divine retribution, as part of the rhetoric of patriarchy, and as necessary for anticolonial nationalism. Students will consider violence both as a theoretical problem as well an aesthetic one as they consider the work of philosophers and theorists while also considering how literary texts drawn from a diverse geographic and historical corpus have attempted to “write” violence as a problem of artistic representation. Some of the texts we may consider include Euripides’ Medea, the epic Mahabharata, Dante’s Inferno, Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, Sorel’s Reflections on Violence, Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj, Simone Weil’s Essay on Force, Franz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth, and the poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Dennis Brutus.	0	0
171	171	CCEA-UH	1018	Imagination, Inspiration, and Prophecy	Do you have to be inspired to write? Does inspiration promise a divine message? Are writers always drawing their ideas literally from “out of this world”? This course explores notions of inspiration and imagination in the prophetic figure of the writer. From Homer to Malcolm X, Nietzsche to Muhammad (PBUH), the figure of the prophet remains a symbol of authority, a chosen bearer of the Word as Truth. This course explores the writer/prophet figure from the Odyssey to the Bible and Qur’an to modern philosophy and contemporary literature and film. It challenges us to examine what we expect of writers, the role they have played as transmitters, diviners, and revealers of “truth,” and their role as social and political critics today. It focuses on how writers look backwards from inside the present or peer into the future through different genres from epic to poetry to prophetic utterances. Texts include selections from the Qur’an, William Blake, William Wordsworth, Karl Marx, Gibran Khalil Gibran, Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, Toni Morrison and others. Short historical, critical, and theoretical readings will supplement and provide context for primary texts.	0	0
172	172	CCEA-UH	1019	Novels That Changed the World	Books transform lives, though few novels make an impact beyond the personal or the literary. Sometimes, however, an extraordinary book may launch a revolution, alter national policy, divide a nation, or unite a continent. Why does this happen to some, but not others? This question seems especially pertinent since a novel is always a hopeful act towards a better world—in both its writing and its reading. This seminar examines the textual, literary, historical, and social circumstances that allowed certain works of fiction to change the facts of our existence. The novel is a relatively young art form that began as entertainment, but its instructive empathy for other ways of being has created an invaluable conversation across borders and between eras. This is why novels are censored or celebrated, and why they remain a vital part of the human experience. Examining such novels as Rizal’s Touch Me Not, Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Sinclair’s The Jungle, Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses, and Multatuli’s Max Havelaar, students will better understand their world through the stories that move people to action.	0	0
173	173	CCEA-UH	1020	Art and Agency	What does art do to us? This course centers on the concept of “Art and Agency,” coined by anthropologist Alfred Gell, which holds that art works carry an agency factor that affects human beings—their mode of thinking, their emotions, their actions, their aesthetic experience. This concept has impacted the way art historians, in academia and the professional museum world, think about and display works of art. Through class discussions and visits to the Louvre Abu Dhabi Museum, the course will examine a host of related ideas: the rhetorical concept of “energeia,” camouflage, iconoclasm, “animism” in prehistoric rock art, Western and Asian landscape imagery, medieval relics and miracle imagery, anthropomorphism and witchcraft in the early modern period, and the idea of “living presence” in abstract expressionism.	0	0
174	174	CCEA-UH	1021J	Jazz in New York	Over the course of the past hundred years, jazz has been framed variously as an erotic display, a symbol of modernity, the sound of the Black avant-garde, “America’s classical music,” a part of our common global cultural heritage, a decadent type of bourgeois entertainment, a virtuosic art form, a revolting noise, and a radical performance of democracy and freedom. Jazz is, in other words, complicated—its densely textured sound world is entwined with a complex social history. This course immerses students in the world of jazz through an exploration of New York City, the undisputed global capital of the genre. During our regular class sessions and a number of evening excursions, students will meet musicians, attend concerts and jam sessions, tour venues, work in archives, listen to recordings, compare notes on the music, and read a broad array of the best jazz scholarship and journalism. They will dig deep into the history of jazz in the city, and also explore the strange and delightful new shapes jazz is taking in the 21st century. By the end of the term, your understanding of jazz and your understanding of New York will be forever changed. No previous experience with music is required.	0	0
175	175	CCEA-UH	1022J	Fascism, Antifascism, and Culture	In common parlance, the terms “fascism” and “culture” resonate as opposites. We think immediately of sterile, bunker-like architecture, book burnings, and reactionary archaisms. Much fascist culture certainly entailed these. Yet we ignore the centrality and complexity of culture to fascist ideas at our own peril. This course examines particular case studies in historical context: Mussolini’s Italy, Nazi Germany, Popular Front and Vichy France, and international anti-fascist activity, particularly in and around the Spanish Civil War. Because of the course’s location in Berlin, we will take advantage of local histories; the example of Nazism looms inevitably palpable here. Yet, as much as possible, we will attempt to develop a more broad theory and history of fascist ideology and its rapport with culture. May we speak of a general fascist theory of culture and representation? How did fascist governments use aesthetics to respond to modernity, or to help create a modernism of their own? Was the concept of an avant-garde inimical to fascist culture, or useful to it? To what extent was there a movement of international anti-fascist resistance? What role did art and literature play in it?	0	0
176	176	CCEA-UH	1023	Dis/Abilities in Musical Contexts	This course asks what dis/Ability is and considers how this concept plays out within a variety of musical contexts. Our focus is not just on musicians with disabilities, but also on a wide spectrum of human musical capabilities. Some scholars argue that our relationship to music is necessarily embodied. In other words, we bring a unique set of physical, sensory, cognitive, and affective capabilities into any musical situation. In this way of thinking, the body, with all its unique characteristics is a central focus of our inquiry. Further into the semester, there will be a unit on Deaf musicians. Students will be exposed to a cultural view of music that remains largely unseen by the hearing world. Thereafter, through self-initiated final research projects, students will work to find their own ways of making meaning of people’s varied musical capabilities.	0	0
177	177	CCEA-UH	1024J	Prague, Capital of Europe	Prague should have been destroyed during the Second World War, like other major cities in Europe, but somehow it wasn’t. The remarkable survival of this exquisite city allows us to explore Central European history and culture in the context of a completely preserved inner urban core dating back to the Middle Ages. Drawing upon primary source readings, cartography, musical performances, art and architecture, the course illuminates the way crosscurrents of European culture became focused in Prague between 1400 and the present. In addition to academic encounters with such figures as Mucha, Kafka, Mozart, and Kundera, the course includes walking tours around Prague, trips to museums and concerts, excursions outside the city, and interactions with leading local performers and thinkers.	0	0
178	178	CCEA-UH	1025J	Experience of Art	What is distinctive about the experiences works of art offer us? Is there a common element in our enjoyment of films, literary works, works of visual art, and musical works? Is there a specific “Western” tradition of art that produces particular kinds of enjoyment? Should one make a distinction between “high” and “popular” art in discussing our experiences? This course will explore such questions by examining some of the answers suggested by philosophers and critics and by testing those answers against our responses to a range of works of art. In doing so, we shall take advantage of the rich artistic resources available in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. Active discussion of our own experiences as we watch films, listen to music, look at works of visual art, and read poems and short fictions will form an important dimension of the class.	0	0
179	179	CCEA-UH	1026J	Shakespeare and Cosmopolitanism	This course uses the London setting to investigate the extent to which “Shakespeare” can serve as the focal point for a cultural heritage that belongs to the entire globe. The course offers a comparative, interdisciplinary approach to Shakespeare’s plays, considering him both as an exemplar of Western literature and also as a world author whose influence can be felt throughout many cultures. The course introduces students to contemporary theories of cosmopolitanism, with particular emphasis on how the idea of cultural difference can shed light on the dynamics both of a vibrant urban setting like London and a corpus of “great” works like Shakespeare’s. In addition to reading Shakespeare’s work and key texts in both cosmopolitan theory and the history of London, students will attend performances of Shakespeare’s plays; visit major London cultural institutions; and make an overnight trip to Shakespeare’s birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon.	0	0
180	180	CCEA-UH	1027	Catastrophe	(Formerly COREA-AD 12)How does the idea of catastrophe shape artistic studies in the 21st century? This interdisciplinary course explores catastrophe through a variety of disciplinary thematics. Students use films and literary texts to explore a range of real or fictional disasters. Can catastrophe serve as a lens to understand notions such as capitalism, globalization, network theory, and ecology?	0	0
181	181	CCEA-UH	1028	Maps	What are maps, and what do they tell us? From prehistoric cave paintings to Mercator projection maps to contemporary mobile apps, maps combine the innovation and rigor of art and science. Maps interpret space in and over time. This course examines maps from the ancient and modern worlds, alongside reinterpretations of mapping in paintings, films, video games, and new media, to understand ways that maps produce knowledge visually.	0	0
182	182	CCEA-UH	1030	Idea of the Exotic	Desert Odysseys, Dark Continents, Virgin Lands, Harem Fantasies: this interdisciplinary course explores the role of visual culture in shaping our outlook of “other” geographies and cultures as “exotic.” We analyze the role of the diverse technologies in mediating between distant geographies, and making the unknown known. Moving across various texts, arts, media, and institutions—museums, maps, photographs, films, TV programs, and digital spaces—the course reflects on how our imagination of ourselves is intertwined with the ways that we imagine other places. The reading includes: Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Mark Twain, The Innocents Abroad; David F. Dorr, A Colored Man Round the World; Jules Verne, Around the World in Eighty Days; and The Letters of Gertrude Bell.	0	0
183	183	CCEA-UH	1034	Death: Myths, Histories, Metamorphoses	Death is a universal fact of human life, powerfully defining the exigencies of our experience. From ancient times until the present, artistic works have registered changing attitudes towards death in the stories they tell. In this seminar, we examine artistic responses to mortality across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts—including in the myths of Orpheus and Osiris, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the text of the Ramayana; the poetry of Darwish, Neruda, and Rilke; stories by Tolstoy, Mishima, and Benjamin; and music of Dowland, Wagner, and Adams. Selected films and plays, including the Noh Drama of Japan, also are considered. Students develop a collaborative or individual artistic project and related critical paper demonstrating their engagement with the topic.	0	0
184	184	CCEA-UH	1035	Staging the Self	This course examines the representation of personal experience in its biographical and autobiographical forms in the arts with a focus on performance. We pay particular attention to the ways in which personhood is aesthetically, psychologically, and politically theorized in different contexts. How is the relationship of individual to collective experience constructed in different art works? Can individual experience portray collective historical reality? Should we understand an artist’s oeuvre in relation to her or his personal life? In what ways do individual art works bestow human experience with specific epistemologies and with social and historical realities? Texts for the course include works by Irving Goffman, Errol Morris, Erik Erikson, Joseph Roach, Freddie Rokem, Deirdre Heddon, and selected plays, films, and museum displays.	0	0
185	185	CCEA-UH	1037	Listening	This course explores ways of listening, and of being a listener, in human experience, with attention to the role of the ear in the constitution of subjects, communities, and societies of different times and places. Topics include debates about the listening subject in Western philosophy and media studies; the role of the “ethnographic ear” in cultural anthropology and ethnomusicology; theories and methods of “soundscape research” and “acoustemology”; and aurality as an aspect of culture, explored through case studies ranging from the development of sound reproduction technologies, to deaf culture, to the ethics of sounding and listening in religious practice. Course readings, drawn from a wide range of disciplines, include foundational texts in the emerging interdisciplinary field of “sound studies.” In addition to engaging critically with a range of ideas and debates through discussion, presentations, and writing, students will try their ears at specialized modes of training and data collection developed by sound-oriented researchers and artists.	0	0
186	186	CCEA-UH	1039	Iconoclasm	(Formerly COREA-AD 55)It is often said that as long as there has been art, there has been iconoclasm, literally from the Greek breaking (klân) of images (eikon). What does it mean to annihilate an image? What motivates the violent destruction of artworks, and what does this applied criticism, perhaps counter-intuitively, tell us about the fundamental impulse to create? Throughout history and across many societies – from biblical sources to Bamiyan buddhas, the Reformation to the Danish cartoon controversy – reformers, idealists, and revolutionaries have sought to silence dissent by erasing artworks that give potent material presence to ideas. Taking a long view of iconoclasm and censorship via case studies ranging from the ancient world to today’s contemporary crises, we will investigate the power of the negated image or what happens when different technologies of picture-making – sculpture, architecture, painting, print, photograph, cartoon and video –  clash in the heated public square and push the politics of representation to its breaking point.	0	0
187	187	CCEA-UH	1042	Cosmopolitan Imagination	Originating in the idea of the world citizen and conceived in contradistinction to nationalism, cosmopolitanism can be understood as a perspective that regards human difference as an opportunity to be embraced rather than a problem to be solved. Does this perspective lie behind all “great” literature, which asks its readers to experience otherness by opening themselves up to another person’s words and thoughts? This course uses novels, poems, plays, and films to explore the cosmopolitan impulses behind the literary imagination.	0	0
188	188	CCEA-UH	1043	Technophilia and Its Discontents	Why must Luke Skywalker turn off his in computer at the climactic moment of George Lucas’s iconic film Star Wars (1977)? The film started a revolution in cinematic special-effects, but underlying its narrative logic is a deeply rooted anxiety about the right uses of technology. If man, as Hannah Arendt famously put it, is homo faber, the “creator,” the tool-making animal, then from at least Plato to the present, human beings have told stories about how dangerous tools can be. This course investigates philosophical writing, novels, plays, and films from a variety of world cultures to explore the vexed relationship between humans and the technologies they create. Why are human beings, perhaps more than ever at the start of the 21st century, so enamored with technological progress? Why is technophilia, the love of technology, so often accompanied by its opposite, technophobia, the fear of technology? What do the attitudes represented in the texts and films we examine tell us about human agency and about the relationship between science and religion?	0	0
189	189	CCEA-UH	1044	Myth, Magic, and Representations of Childhood	This course is fueled by two related questions: how have cultural ideas of “childhood” changed over time, and how have ancient tales of myth and magic found expression in cultures around the world? Almost every culture in the world has some tradition that includes mythical or magical tales; very often these tales include the exploits of a youthful protagonist. What can these tales, and their evolution—and transmission—over time and place, reveal to us about our own cultural preoccupations, as well as the cultures where these tales were originally produced? Through an examination of materials including graphic novels, fairy tales, movies, and fiction, we will consider how representations of childhood reveal ideas about power, politics, and the relationship between self and society. Readings may include excerpts from The Arabian Nights; Grimm’s fairy tales; various Harry Potter novels; films from Hiyao Miyazaki, Disney, and Pixar, among others.	0	0
190	190	CCEA-UH	1045	Stigma	(Formerly COREP-AD 32)Societies develop cultural behaviors that indicate the relative value of their members. Social acceptance has been historically dependent on its mutually constitutive term – ostracism – as members act on how they perceive and maintain their status in relationship to others. This class uses novels, memoirs, and plays to examine and deconstruct systems of social worth, asking how the nuances of those systems create and enforce devalued categories of people. Readings focus on works that consider the specific attributes that adhere to the historically stigmatized categories of illness and disability. We will discover how stigma affects feelings of self-worth and mediates engagement with others. Sociologist Erving Goffman observed that stigma creates “spoiled identities.” Using ideas offered in Goffman’s seminal text on stigma, and anthropologist Mary Douglas’s work on pollution and taboo, students will read other work that deconstructs experiences of stigma in order to destabilize, revise, and repair the personal and social damage stigmatizing categories and behaviors inflict.	0	0
191	191	CCEA-UH	1046	Rogue Fictions: Tales of Tricksters, Outlaws, and Outsiders	From mythological figures such as Coyote in North America, Hermes of Greek myth, and Eshu in West Africa, to modern icons of global pop culture like Charlie Chaplin, Bugs Bunny, and Bart Simpson, humans have long been fascinated with trickster characters who transgress boundaries, break rules, and unsettle fixed truths. Seemingly heedless of cultural norms, these characters in their many different guises point to the important role of play and disruption in the making of culture. In this course, students consider rogues, outlaws, and outsiders of various types from around the world and their portrayal in stories, novels, dramas, songs, and films. Building a repertoire of trickster characters, types, and tropes, students examine how these characters’ dynamic roles relate to central problems of art, creativity, and life.	0	0
192	192	CCEA-UH	1047	Utopias and Dystopias	We all think about wanting to live in the perfect world, but what happens when definitions of “perfect” conflict with one another? Drawing on written and cinematic texts from around the world, this course explores ways in which writers and artists have wrestled with the question of “utopia” and, more particularly, the ways in which utopias always seem to fall short of their ideal. As we examine these failed utopias, we will consider how these texts explore the increasingly fraught relationship between humanity and technology, and between the community and the individual. Is any attempt at utopia doomed, given the human proclivity for violence and xenophobia? Why, in recent years, have dystopian worlds become the mainstay of pop culture, from novels to video games and movies? The course may include contemporary work by Hiyao Miyazaki, Chan Koonchung, and Vladimir Sorokin, as well as such classics as Thomas More’s Utopia, Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland, and Fritz Lang’s Metropolis.	0	0
193	193	CCEA-UH	1048	Pilgrimage and Enlightenment	(Formerly COREP-AD 54)For much of human history, the West meant India, the source of Buddhism, and a destination for pilgrims in search of enlightenment. This course examines the relationship between pilgrimage and enlightenment. Is pilgrimage a metaphor of a life well lived, or must it be a literal journey in search of a higher state of being? Is the purpose of pilgrimage to reach a destination, or is the journey itself, wherever it leads, more important? When is pilgrimage an individual affair, and when are more communal aspects essential to the journey? We begin our journey in India with Ashvagosha's Life of the Buddha, and then follow a trail of religious cultural production – including sutras, mandalas, and records of individual pilgrims – that culminates in the Chinese literary masterpiece, Journey to the West. The course then turns to “non-Eastern” adaptations of Journey, including Maxine Hong Kingston's Tripmaster Monkey and such films as The Lost Empire, before closing with comparisons of Buddhist pilgrimage with the Hajj, as well as “modern Western” journeys to Asia in search of spiritual alternatives to material civilization.	0	0
194	194	CCEA-UH	1049	Knowledge and Doubt	This course explores the relation of knowledge and doubt in a wide variety of texts in different genres, historical periods, and cultural contexts. Some key questions will concern sources of knowledge and evidence, while others will be about the nature of our capacities for knowing things. These questions include: What sources of knowledge can we trust, if any? Are there ways to achieve knowledge by transcending our normal sensory and rational capacities? Might we be systematically deceived about the world and, if so, could we still find happiness in such a condition? Is our knowledge inevitably dependent on others or are our best sources of knowledge found within? How can our knowledge be distorted by strong emotions such as hatred or love? Readings will be from Mo-Tzu, Sophocles, Nagarjuna, Ibn Tufayl, Dante, Montaigne, Cervantes, Descartes, Hume, Rousseau, and Proust.	0	0
195	195	CCEA-UH	1050	Optimism and Knowledge	Is this the best of all possible worlds? Is this world knowable? The concept of “optimism” arose in the West at the intersection of these two questions. The European Enlightenment engaged the world as something that could and should be known because knowing could make it better. This optimism was a new attitude towards knowledge that does not dissolve into pessimism at the first sign of difficulty. The seminar takes this history of optimism on the road with two primary stops. In China, students will engage what’s been called the “epistemological optimism” of Xunzi and Confucius. The course then circles back to the Middle East to take advantage of Th. Emil Homerin’s new translations of A’ishah al-Ba’uniyyah, one of the most “prolific and prominent women who wrote in Arabic prior to the modern period,” and track optimism’s role in Islamic legal theory. Haunting all of these travels will be the issue of whether NYUAD is itself an act of “epistemological optimism,” and thus an institutional answer to the questions posed at the start of our journey.	0	0
196	196	CCEA-UH	1051	Cultural Memory and Resistance	As the Atlantic slave trade forcibly dispersed Africans throughout Europe and the Americas over four centuries, cultural memory became a key component of survival for those who journeyed through the Middle Passage. How did languages incorporate modes of expression—creole, patois, pidgin—that connected with scarce-remembered cosmologies and ways of being to allow for resistance to systems of oppression? And how was the traditional music of African peoples reconstructed with new instruments and inflections during this process? We will examine texts ranging from Plato, the Book of Exodus, Ibn Battuta, The Tale of Sundiata, early African slave narratives; the music of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone; works by Amiri Baraka, Aimé Césaire, Edouard Glissant, Wole Soyinka, Mos Def, Common, Nubian Sisters, Saul Williams, Talib Kweli, Tupac Shakur; and films such as Sugar Cane Alley, La Haine, Illmatic, and Belle to understand better some key components of cultural memory and resistance.	0	0
197	197	CCEA-UH	1052	Confession	Confession is a cultural practice that grew out of a religious context to become something more: a practice that—though now removed from religion directly—arguably carries many of the same functions, such as divulgence of transgression and absolution of sin. This seminar explores confession as a religious and cultural practice and asks what, why, and how people confess through writing and performance? If confession is no longer always religiously determined, what possesses humans to confess our secrets, and why do readers and spectators care? Furthermore, how does secular confession operate in a globalized world? Do confessional practices traverse the globe? By broadening the Christian definition of confession and drawing on student- generated material, we will examine confession from an intercultural point of view and determine what we can learn about a culture by the kind of secrets it keeps and the nature of its confessional practices. Students should expect to read Hannah Arendt, Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Rustom Barucha, Joan Didion, Sigmund Freud, Allen Ginsberg, Koffi Kwahulé, Jean Racine, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.	0	0
198	198	CCEA-UH	1053	The Hero	What does it mean to be a hero? Can one still be “heroic” in times marked by intense and jarring forms of violence? How does heroism travel across diverse places and beyond the frontline to intersect with mundane questions of survival as well as more severe issues of racial, class, and gender differences? And why do tales of heroism remain so persistently appealing to us today? In this course, we will examine the concept of the hero in world literature from ancient epic to postmodern fiction and film. We will investigate how the ideals of heroism, types of heroes/heroines and antiheroes, as well as modes of heroic action change through time, across literary genres and cultural traditions. Texts may include the Epic of Gilgamesh, Sophocles’ Antigone, Sīrat 'Antar, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, Pynchon’s Crying of Lot 49, graphic novels, selections from the Bible, the Qur’an, and the One Thousand and One Nights, and films such as Birdman, Lord of the Rings, and 300.	0	0
199	199	CCEA-UH	1054	Catastrophe into Art:  Drama, Dissolution, and Philosophy	We typically think of tragic dramas as staging destruction and dissolution, but many audience members come away with a sense of reconciliation, resolution, and understanding. Aristotle, at least, took something like this to be tragedy’s actual goal. Can viewing others’ suffering support such a positive view? From the time of Plato, other philosophers have been hostile to tragedy, arguing that it gets people too excited and in the wrong ways. Yet another view holds that tragedy does too little, that it is merely entertainment in the service of the powers that be – composed, one might argue, by men for men in order to reinforce a particular political, social, and economic outlook. This course examines these and other perennial questions about tragic drama by reading a wide range of plays from different periods and traditions. Authors include Sophocles, Sudraka, Hanquing, Motokiyo, Behn, Ibsen, Artaud, Brecht, Beckett, Soyinka, Glaspell, Parks, and Mouawad. Students will also examine dramatic theory and criticism from Plato and Aristotle, to Nietzsche, Shaw, and contemporary theorists such as Agamben and Cixous.	0	0
200	200	CCEA-UH	1055	Global Shakespeare	To what extent can “Shakespeare” serve as the focal point for a cultural heritage that belongs to the entire globe? This course offers a comparative, interdisciplinary approach to Shakespeare’s plays, considering them both as exemplary of Western literature and also as world literature, influential in many cultures. Three sets of questions ground the course: 1) In what ways was Shakespeare a “global” author in his own day, adopting a “worldly” approach that transcends his English context? 2) How do the publication, performance, and critical histories of his plays transform “Shakespeare” into a global commodity? 3) What cultural legacy has Shakespeare’s work left for a variety of global media forms, including plays, films, novels, operas, an d works of visual art? The course begins with two plays, Othello and The Tempest, that have inspired adaptations in a variety of contexts and genres. It then pays close attention to the global spread of Shakespeare’s most famous play, Hamlet, from 1603 to the present. The course concludes with a creative project inspired by Shakespeare’s lost play, Cardenio.	0	0
201	201	CCEA-UH	1056	Tragedy	Tragic dramas from different cultures and periods have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about how human beings face suffering, violence, and death. Drawing on these broad traditions, students will explore the dramatic forms, social contexts, and rhetorical and political goals of tragedies in an attempt to understand how drama can turn catastrophe into art—and why. By what means does tragedy take horrific and often degrading experiences and transform them into artistic experiences that are (sometimes) intelligible, pleasurable, or beautiful? Should witnessing the misery of others ever be pleasurable or beautiful? Can we presume to make sense of another's suffering? How, more generally, can tragic drama help us come to terms with the violence and brutality of the human condition—or does it sometimes hinder this attempt?	0	0
202	202	CCEA-UH	1057	Our Monsters, Ourselves	Drawing from literature of the past 200 years, this course considers basic questions: What does it mean to be human—and who do we include in our definitions of “human”? What is the relationship of people to their landscape and environment? What is the relationship of technology to cultural production? How do gender and sexuality define or liberate us? And, ultimately, does the artist have an obligation to address any of these issues in his/her work? As a guide to our explorations, we look at the ways in which monsters and the monstrous illuminate particular cultural moments and reflect on whether the monsters of two centuries ago shed light on our own cultural preoccupations.	0	0
203	203	CCEA-UH	1060	Photography and Narrative	This course explores photography’s relationship to language and narrative by examining photography’s rich interactions with literature and film. How do images complement, replace, challenge, or exceed language in narrative works? Can images create alternative forms of narrative? What kind of narratives do photographs generate in fiction? What is the relationship of photography and memory in works of autobiography or of photography and witnessing in social documentary? In what form are such dialogues present in films? Students will examine a variety of works from around the world which are entirely or almost entirely visual; works in which images and text are combined in creative partnership; and works which are about photographs but in which no images are actually reproduced.	0	0
204	204	CCEA-UH	1061	Memory	What is memory? We tend to think it will be activated when the right moment comes, but our experiences may belie our thinking, such as when we forget a name just when we need it. A variety of disciplines and theories approach the phenomenon of memory: cognitive science, computer science, biology, psychology, sociology, media theory, theory of perception, philosophy, history, cultural history and art history, trauma theory, heritage studies. And we can observe a huge variety of attempts to preserve memories: monuments, memorials, museums, libraries, archives, rituals, writing, film, and even ephemeral forms such as blog posts or status updates (nothing gets lost in the Web!). The course allows students to sample these various approaches without being restricted to any one of them as they explore fundamental questions about the relationship between memory and human identity: Is memory everything we can remember, or everything we can forget? How can we know memories from dreams or fantasies? Do we remember things as they really were or as they never were? Is memory what we take for granted and thus an impediment to creative thinking, or is it the prerequisite of creative activity?	0	0
205	205	CCEA-UH	1062	Everything Is a Remix	Is anything original? Before “remixes” had that name, they went by many others, including “tradition and the individual talent,” parody, pastiche, burlesque, adaptation, dialogism, collage, detournement, refunctioning, intertextuality, intermediality, transtextuality, and the carnivalesque. Asking what happens when we make something new from something old, this course explores artistic and interpretative remix practices that are both very ancient and extremely contemporary. While “remix” is a recent term that evokes studio production and Internet culture, understanding its roots obliges us to go back to long-standing traditions in arts and culture generally. Although the course focuses to some extent on film adaptations of literary works, it should be of interest to students curious about music, film, and artistic adaptation in general, but also with our mass-mediated social environment that thrives on sampling, mash-ups, memes, and adaptation.	0	0
206	206	CCEA-UH	1063	Literary Translation	This course explores the craft of and the market for literary translation. Why do some translators aim for familiarity and others for estrangement? What is lost, and perhaps even gained, in a text’s cultural relocation? What can be accessed in translation and what are the limits of translation? Translation, and translation projects such as NYUAD’s Library of Arabic Literature, play a pivotal role in shaping intercultural exchange and globalizing literary markets and canons. The course familiarizes students with practices and theories of translation from different literary traditions. Case studies include comparative examples drawn from distinct genres such as the epic, forms of lyric poetry, drama, and modern prose fiction. Not available to students who have taken LITCW-UH 1140.	0	0
207	207	CCEA-UH	1064X	Crisis and Creativity	How is creativity shaped by place and how can it flourish under crisis? A number of cataclysmic events have afflicted the Arab world in recent years, yet filmmakers have persisted in their desire to tell their stories, against the odds, in creative acts that attest to their imagination, courage and resilience. While news reporting tends to present crisis in abstract, humanitarian or Orientalist terms, how do filmmakers build new perceptions, rather than merely confirming existing ones? This course reflects on these questions, together with the often-fraught relationship between art and politics. Starting with a critical interrogation of the terms “crisis” and “creativity,” we will explore various creative strategies f or depicting crisis in contemporary cinema. Although our main reference point will be films from and about the Arab world, specifically, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, we will also build comparisons with films from Iran, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Denmark, UK, USA, Spain, India and elsewhere.	0	0
208	208	CCEA-UH	1065X	Nationalism, Art and Entertainment	How do we understand the relationship between nationalism and the arts? In both Europe and the Middle East, nationalism corresponded with the rise of new performance forms, literary genres, artistic movements, and innovations in media and communication technologies that created their region’s first mass audiences for newspapers, novels, prints, exhibitions, romantic drama, and musical theatre. Exploring this wide variety of materials, students will consider a range of questions to understand better how political and cultural formations relate. Is the medium the message? Did mass culture enable nationalism? Are such relationships stable across time and place? Students will examine religious and political arguments in newspapers and pamphlets; nationalist sentiment in poems, plays, and novels; and secondary sources in political science and history. The course’s first two units contrast the invention of the nation in Europe (during the Romantic period) and in the Levant (during the Arab Renaissance or nahda). The third unit looks at nationalism’s contemporary resurgence. All three units examine the role of art and entertainment in disseminating and shaping nationalist ideologies.	0	0
209	209	CCEA-UH	1066	Unknown World	(Formerly COREP-AD 59)For most of human history, anything beyond one’s place of residence was unknown and mysterious, perhaps frightening and perilous, or perhaps hugely exciting. How did people imagine, discover, experience, and express what they found to exist beyond the limits of their first-hand experiences? We will read various pieces of literature, and some scholarship about that literature, which reflect on the unknown world – books of travel, conquest, adventure, exploration, mystery, and wonder. How do the authors represent the unknown and describe places they have never seen? What do they attempt to “do” with the unknown, or to make the unknown do? We will engage with texts such as: Arrian, Indika; Tacitus, Germania; The Journey of Theophanes; Al-Biruni, Indica; Marco Polo, Description of the World; Ibn Battuta, The Journey; The Legend of Prester John; Alvise Cadamosto, Navigazioni; The Four Voyages of Christopher Columbus; Hakluyt, Divers Voyages; The Journals of Lewis and Clark.	0	0
210	210	CCEA-UH	1068J	City of Encounters: Literatures of Indigeneity, Migration and Settlement	Known for its beaches, sports grounds, and stunning harbor views, Sydney is also Australia’s preeminent literary and cultural city. Additionally, it is the country’s first settler city, a site of continuous indigenous presence, as well as port-of-entry for much of the country’s vast immigrant population. Using literature and the spaces of Sydney itself as a lens, this course examines Australian culture as a place of encounters, movements, and crossings. The course begins with literary representations of indigenous histories, European invasion, and settler colonialism, paired with walking tours of Sydney’s colonial architecture and indigenous art collections at the Australian Museum. It then turns to literary reckonings of the “White Australia Policy” (dismantled in the late 1960s/early 1970s) and postwar waves of migration and settlement to consider today’s fragile “multiculturalism” in an age of anti-refugee policies. Treating Sydney as both a literary space—comprising a complex, contested imaginative and cultural geography—and a space for first-hand inquiry, the course will supplement discussion with immersion in Sydney’s immigrant neighborhoods and vibrant cultural scenes.	0	0
211	211	CCEA-UH	1069	Cultural Appropriation	Virtually unknown outside of academic discourse until very recently, the term cultural appropriation has become a commonplace in social and popular media, as activists and public intellectuals have highlighted what they see as problematic uses (or abuses) of cultural symbols, artifacts, or expressive modes connected to marginalized groups. But what exactly is cultural appropriation, and under what circumstances can it be said to constitute a form of exploitation or violence? This course approaches these questions both philosophically and empirically, asking, on the one hand: What is culture, and how can it be “owned” or “stolen”? and  on the other: How have practices of adopting or using culture been implicated in processes of social subjugation or marginalization? Course readings are drawn from a range of disciplines across the humanities and social sciences, including cultural anthropology, art theory, music studies, and philosophy. By engaging with a rich corpus of ideas through in-class discussions, oral presentations, and written reflections, students will develop critical perspectives on cultural appropriation as well as the broader concepts of culture, race, and ethnicity.	0	0
212	212	CCEA-UH	1071J	Imagining the Renaissance City	Northern and central Italy’s bustling towns inspired many of today’s modern cities. This course examines three such cases. Florence was a powerhouse of culture and industry, Siena the Wall Street of Europe (with skyline to match), and Pisa, king of the Mediterranean before being overtaken by Florence in the 15th century. Students will get to know what made these cities tick, how they jostled for power in Tuscany, and why their innovations have been so enduring. Our access to these Renaissance cities is largely through art: their buildings, their paintings, and the words in which they were represented, reconfigured, condemned. Thus the seminar explores the way that both contemporaries and moderns imagined those cities, in words, images, and sounds. What kinds of stories did urban Renaissance men and women tell about their communities, the threats they faced from within and without, their hopes and aspirations, their fears as to what life would be like should their cities cease to exist? Dante, St. Catherine of Siena, the painter Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Italo Calvino and others will guide students’ explorations of some of the most mysterious and fascinating cities in the world.	0	0
213	213	CCEA-UH	1072	Discovery and Recognition in Narrative, Film, and Drama	Across all cultures, stories are fashioned to withhold information at first, holding our attention through suspense. They then produce disclosures at crucial moments of denouement. For Aristotle, this dynamic movement from ignorance to knowledge is essential, especially when it takes the form of the discovery - or recognition - of previously unknown identity. Tracing an arc from the ancient world to the present day, students study how the epistemology of modern storytelling across cultures disturbs the familiar patterns of clear and comforting revelation associated with classic genres. Readings include Aristotle’s Poetics; Oedipus Rex; the Odyssey; the Old Testament; the Gospels of Mark and John; the Qur’an; the Arabian Nights; Shakespeare’s King Lear; Naguib Mafouz; and films from the 1940s to the present.	0	0
214	214	CCEA-UH	1073J	Recovered Voices: Artistic and Musical Cultures from Prague to Theresienstadt	This seminar examines texts and contexts of Czech-Jewish-German musical and artistic culture that flourished in Prague between the World Wars, when a new generation of avant-garde composers and artists reshaped the city’s artistic cultures. Facing postwar political and social uncertainties and impacted by the rise of National Socialism after 1933, many artists were forced into exile, while others were deported to the Czech transit and concentration camp Theresienstadt. Facing illness and death, the prisoners at Theresienstadt forged an underground cultural life that included concerts, lectures, and art exhibits. The seminar engages with developments in Theresienstadt between 1942 and 1944 through the work of composers Haas, Klein, Krasa, and Ullmann, as well as other visual artists and writers imprisoned there. Using journals and a camera, students will explore the physical sites and cultural spaces of Prague and Theresienstadt, as a unique window onto the ideas and experiences of 20th-century modernism.	0	0
215	215	CCEA-UH	1074	Interracial Literature	This course examines a wide variety of literary texts on black-white couples, interracial families, and biracial identity, from classical antiquity to the present. Works studied include romances, novellas, plays, novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction, as well as some films and examples from the visual arts. Topics for discussion range from interracial genealogies to racial “passing,” from representations of racial difference to alternative plot resolutions, and from religious and politic al to legal and scientific contexts for the changing understanding of “race.” Focus is on the European and American traditions, and students are encouraged to supplement course discussions by introducing other literatures as appropriate.	0	0
216	216	CCEA-UH	1075	Life Underground	From the slavery-era United States to literature of the Soviet Union to the contemporary art and film scenes around the world, the idea of “the underground” has been a site of resistance, exploration, and innovation. This course explores the powerful metaphor of “underground” to consider how, or if, it is possible for what happens underground to change what happens above. Readings from a variety of cultures will consider the relationship between the avant-garde and the mainstream, the power of language to shape cultural understanding, and the sometimes dangerous allure of worlds we cannot see. Course materials will include literature, movies, and visual art.	0	0
217	217	CCEA-UH	1076	Gender and the Future of Normal	We come from a range of different cultural experiences. How, then, do we consider normativity as we relate to our bodies and to gender expressions within shifting, social realities? When we enter public spheres, do our bodies complement or disrupt cultural expectations of normalcy? What are these expectations? How rooted are they in cultural ideologies and practices? What registers as non-normative and to what consequences? This course examines a range of writing, historical and contemporary, about gender expression in lived experience as well as in texts intended for live performance. These latter “textual performances” capture how artists have imagined and inscribed tensions between gender normativity and variation. How does the aliveness of gender performance (normative or disruptive) negotiate the dynamic among lived experience, textual performances, and live performance? Finally, how do our own gender expressions perform their aliveness in today’s world? Works from Jordan, Egypt, Palestine, France, South Africa, Uganda, Ireland, Greece, India, and Mexico, among others, are focal points for critical inquiry.	0	0
218	218	CCEA-UH	1077X	Islamism, Islamophobia, and Muslim Popular Culture	As state apparatuses everywhere attempt to control their citizenry either directly (though force) or hegemonically (via consent of the governed), popular youth cultures become the ideological terrain on which battles for freedom of expression are fought. In the case of Muslim cultures, the contest is sometimes framed in terms of secular liberalism of thought and behavior, at others, in support of stricter religious orthodoxy even as the language and forms deployed are those of pop culture viz. “Islamic” fashion, music, comic books, film, theater, etc. This course will explore such tensions and the ethical challenges they pose in an increasingly global society through a variety of pop culture forms and subcultures from around the Muslim world. The challenge the course presents-one that requires students to synthesize materials from many disciplines-is to think through the ongoing battle for hearts and minds of Muslim youth around the world. This battle can be summed up through the competing ideologies of Islamism at one extreme and Islamophobia at the other. How do we steer a course between this contemporary Scylla and Charybdis? Herein lies the task.	0	0
219	219	CCEA-UH	1078X	Representing the Middle East: Issues in the Politics of Culture	Media depictions of the Middle East have transnational ramifications on political discourse and cultural identification around the globe. This seminar explores the cultural politics of such representations, beginning from the premise that representation itself is a contested site. Students will examine film, visual culture, and literature to ask how “the real” is mediated for various audiences. How can key dilemmas be best approached, such as the clash between theological taboos and notions of freedom of expression in recent controversies about Danish cartoons and Charlie Hebdo? Can readings of texts, films, and digital spaces see beyond familiar negative stereotypes or positive public images? The seminar will be organized around significant themes, concepts, and questions, including the exotic and the imperial imaginary; travel and the Holy Land; gender and national allegory; the representation of the “real”; religious taboo and visual representation; antiquity in contemporary popular culture; memoir and the post/colonial gaze; and dislocation and diaspora in the transnational reception of Middle Eastern cinema, art, and culture.	0	0
220	220	CCEA-UH	1079J	Art, Education and Barbarism in Berlin	On May 10, 1933, students from the University of Berlin piled books from the State library onto carts, dumped them next to the Opera House, and set them alight. As Heinrich Heine had presciently observed, “Where books are burned, people will follow.” How did a nation that had seen itself as the land of “Dichter und Denker” - home to artists and philosophers such as Goethe, Kant, Beethoven, and Hegel - come to commit the most barbarous crimes in human history? This central question will be examined by reading not only Hitler’s Mein Kampf, but also key works by Schiller, Goethe and Wagner that inspired the German cultural nationalism of the late 19th and 20th centuries. At the same time, we will explore through the writings of Kant, Moses Mendelssohn and Lessing the Enlightenment tradition in Germany which, though it proved too weak in 1933, laid the groundwork for today’s liberal democratic Federal Republic. Relevant site visits include Frederick the Great’s palace Sans Souci, the Old National Gallery on Museum Island and the Topography of Terror exhibition at the former Gestapo headquarters. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.	0	0
221	221	CCEA-UH	1080X	Food, Culture, and Politics	“You are what you eat.” We have all heard this truism in one form or another. A more productive approach follows the French gastronome Brillat-Savarin’s famous statement, “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you who you are.” We are how we eat, how we think about what we eat, and how we procure the foods that we eat. Food relates intimately to who we are as individuals and members of families and broader communities, and as a species. What can analysis of food teach us about the construction of meaning, order, and values in our lives? How do patterns in the production, distribution, and consumption of food promote social categorizations such as gender, ethnicity, religion, education, race, status, and class? How do scholars research local foodways in the context of global changes in systems of food production? What is the future of food in a world marked by increasing socio-economic inequalities and the threat of climate change? How we approach the question of what to eat therefore serves as a vehicle for understanding the construction of meaning and the contradictions of our adaptations to changing natural and social environments.	0	0
222	222	CCEA-UH	1081	Sense and Senses	What does it mean to study the senses? One way to approach this is to recognize, as anthropologists do, that sensory perception, which is experienced by the individual as a physical and biological capacity to engage with the world around us, is also always a cultural act. This class explores how gender, sexuality, ethnicity and class are embodied in sensory perceptions and everyday social interactions. Students will examine how our physiological capacities are engaged and reproduced in social, economic and political relations of power which are the outcome of complex historical trajectories. Discussions include a broad range of scholarly debates on the senses and sensory perception drawn from the anthropology of the senses, human geography, cultural history, film, museum studies, impairment and disability studies, literature, and art. The class will focus in particular on how corporeal practices involving food, art, music and movement are perceived, mediated and expressed through the senses.	0	0
223	223	CCEA-UH	1082	Literature of Migration	This course traces the theme of migration from the sixth century B.C.E. to the present and examines foundational, modern, and contemporary versions of migration experiences. Readings include scripture, epic and lyric poetry, epigrams and aphorisms, autobiography, reportage, documentary photography and film as well as fiction and examples of creative work in photography, film, and the visual arts. How has the process of migration been imagined and how have migrants and migration been represented in literature and visual arts, whether produced by migrants themselves or by others? What are the commonplaces (topoi) associated with migration, from fearing to yearning to be elsewhere and from nostalgia for the home (nostos) to making a home elsewhere? How has the emergence of migration literature (at times located between countries and languages) affected both national literary histories and notions of world literature? Works and even words (including the term “migration”) have also migrated, and so the course will pay some attention to “wanderwords” and to translation as an intrinsic part of the cultural history of migration.	0	0
224	224	CCEA-UH	1083	Falconry: Cultural Inheritance and Social Imaginary	The history of falconry is not a hunting story. It’s a story of human imagination of self, society, and the natural world. Approaching falconry as a “social fact” and as an example of what specialists refer to as “intangible heritage,” this course asks what human engagements with these birds of prey, across time and culture, reveal about relationships between humans and nature—relationships of ethics and respect, but also of desire and domination. How might a close examination of falconry help explain the emergence and transformation of social categories such as nobility and poverty, male and female, believer and pagan, citizen and foreigner? How might it require us to confront human fragility—our bodily, intellectual, and spiritual limits, our experiences of joy, love, youth, death, faith, science, and more? Engaging with texts, images, and films, students will ask how humans use non-human species to understand and define ourselves, our civilizations, and our aspirations across a rang e of ethnic, religious, historical, and geographical differences.	0	0
225	225	CCEA-UH	1085	Cinematic Imagination: Music, Media, and Modernity	Do new media change the way we think and perceive the world around us? What does it mean to live in an era after film has reshaped our capacity for documentation and visual expression? In order to explore such fundamental questions, this course focuses on artistic developments during the Weimar period (1918-1933), when Berlin became a vibrant cultural center after World War I. As the emergence of German film provided new aesthetic principles of artistic production and reception, traditional art forms such as literature, theatre, painting, photography, and music were reframed by a new “cinematic imagination.” Engaging with the work of cultural theorists who first witnessed the impact of film, photography, radio, and gramophone, the course also explores recent interdisciplinary scholarship in media studies to understand how new technologies shape social and political concerns. A hands-on film project allows students to explore Abu Dhabi’s urban cityscapes to create a remake of Walter Ruttman’s 1927 film Berlin: Symphony of a City. How can this reflection on modernity and modernization in 1920s Berlin help us understand the cinematic imagination's mediation of urban spaces today?	0	0
226	226	CCEA-UH	1087J	Confessional Culture from Augustine to Oprah	Michel Foucault famously argued that the West has become a “singularly confessing society” and western subjects have become “confessing animals.” What does he mean by this? And is the urge and incentive to confess restricted to the West, as Foucault would have it? The word “become” implies that confession has not always occupied such a central role. This course offers an overview of the confession - in the West but not only there - asking into the different uses and forms confession has historically taken. Particular emphasis will be set on considering: the “secularization” of Christian confessional practices; confession as a way of generating experiences of “interiority” or “depth” self; the mutual influence between religious and legal models of confession; and the relationship between confession and sexuality. What does it mean to confess “truly”? Can confessions be false? If confession is a “talking cure,” what is the confession supposed to cure? And whom? NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Greece.	0	0
227	227	CCEA-UH	1088J	Selves and Non-Selves in Arts and Literatures	Students in this course study representations of selves – their own, others’, collectives, and non-selves - in literature, art, and music. Examples come from around the world; mostly contemporary and Modern but we won’t ignore ancient and pre-Modern. A kernel-question guides our investigations: can selves/not-selves be known in artistic expressions, and if so, how and why? Autobiography, self-portraiture, and self-referential music and films will be primary texts, classified into four different voices: confession, accusation, aggregation, and nomothetic. Expect to read works by Whitman, Kincaid, Woolf, Gandhi, Borges, Xun, and Stein. Examples of portrait artists to be studied include Rembrandt, Leyster, van Gogh, Kahlo, and Warhol. Filmmakers who practice self-representation will include Deren, Anger, Riggs, and Varda. Music by Beyoncé, Ono/Lennon, ali-Khan, and Marvi will be studied.	0	0
228	228	CCEA-UH	1089	Gardens of Eden	Why is the garden one of the oldest and most pervasive modes of human intervention in the environment? This course explores the garden as a major art form by focusing on pictorial and spatial representations of the Garden of Eden. The Edenic Paradise of Genesis and the Qur’an gives us access to thought about gardens in the ancient Middle East. As a foundational idea in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The representation of Eden in painting and sculpture is closely entwined with the history of garden design, and this seminar examines both. The course introduces fundamental methods of art history as students examine gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, early Christian monasteries, Syrian and Andalusian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Persian court paintings, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. Field trips include outings to gardens and collections in the United Arab Emirates and the seminar concludes with a collaborative garden design project in Abu Dhabi. NOTE: This course has a spring break trip to Spain.	0	0
229	229	CCEA-UH	1090	Un/Making History	“There is that great proverb,” the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe once said, “that until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.” Is history inevitably written by the winners? Who decides which stories are told and heard, or how they shape collective memory? Can artists effectively act as historians, with the agency to shape counternarratives? This course explores contemporary art that draws on documentary and archival material—the stuff of “history”—to create performance and films that tell stories otherwise lost, forgotten, or displaced. Special attention will be paid to how these stories may participate in the process of decolonization, shape understandings of postwar realities, and generate debates in the global art world and society at large. Students will engage with the work of leading artists from Japan, South Asia, and South East Asia who explore the mechanisms of postcolonial history at the intersection of analog and digital media, fiction and nonfiction, poetry, and testimony. Theoretical texts include work by Eric Hobsbawm, Michel Foucault, Aimé Césaire, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Okwui Enwezor, and Vijay Prashad.	0	0
230	230	CCEA-UH	1091	Narrating Migration	Stories about migrants and the politics of migration have been told across media forms, platforms and genres.  Depending on the registers used and the location from where narrated, migration is increasingly perceived as a national or global crisis, a humanitarian emergency, or as economic opportunity.  Questions of mediation profoundly shape the circulation and the contours of the narrative. The course will 1) review some key themes about global migration in diverse contexts, 2) examine the role of media and mediation in constructing the migrant experience; 3) engage and critique digital archives of migration. The course will culminate in a media project where students produce their own digital media narratives of migration.	0	0
231	231	CCOL-UH	1000	Mortal and Immortal Questions	Conceptions of death and the afterlife not only structure traditional religious beliefs and practices, but they also subtly inform politics, scientific research, and societies more widely. How societies mete out punishment, engage in war, treat animals, distribute funds for scientific research or medical treatment, give legal expression to various moral mandates, etc. all are rooted in their attitudes and beliefs about death and the afterlife. This colloquium takes up a range of literary, political, and philosophical works from different cultures and periods that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about death and immortality. How long should people live? How would immortality impact the planet’s resources? And how might these questions inflect our views about recent technological efforts to extend life and ultimately to achieve immortality virtual or otherwise? Students will confront such questions from a variety of moral, scientific, and cultural perspectives and explore the role that death plays in their own lives and in those of other peoples and societies.	0	0
232	232	CCOL-UH	1001	Dignity and Indignity	Dignity, a concept elaborated for its emancipatory potential, has come to serve varied ends. Beginning with contemporary evocations of the notion of dignity within international institutions (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), bioethics (stem-cell research and end-of-life care), and socio-economics (the Indignants Movement and the Vatican’s “Dignity of Labor”), this class traces distinct and often conflicting conceptions of the term “dignity.” It investigates the ways in which the notion and experience of human dignity have come under assault in the modern world system, with its corresponding economic, social, and cultural practices. A series of historical investigations into philosophical definitions, visual and literary expressions, key official documents, and personal narratives will lead the class to ask whether the contemporary period may recover or conserve the liberating potential of dignity in our evolving world system.	0	0
233	233	CCOL-UH	1002	Indigeneity	This course explores the quality and concept of indigeneity – or native belonging – as a force of history and nature. It will examine trajectories of indigenous peoples, paying attention to relationships between indigenous peoples and their respective settler-states, and to how legacies of conflict and accommodation raise difficult questions about economic, cultural, and political justice. It will also look at “at-risk” ecologies currently threated by so-called invasive species, asking if notions of justice apply equally to the natural world, and if not what alternatives are available for protecting the non-human. Science, Social Science, and Culture converge in this class, in an inquiry into who or what came first, and why it matters for where we go next. Students examine local manifestations of global phenomena through case studies drawn from the Americas, the north and south Pacific, and Zomia. Readings are drawn from the fields of anthropology, environmental studies, ethnopharmacology, history, and public policy, and also include memoirs and personal testimony.	0	0
234	234	CCOL-UH	1003X	Faith in Science, Reason in Revelation	We live simultaneously in an age of science and an era of great religious faith, when reason and revelation are often depicted as being in inherent and eternal tension. This course traces the history of the relationship of religion and science in Christendom and Islamdom from the Middle Ages to the present day. As a colloquium within NYU Abu Dhabi’s Core Curriculum, the course addresses the global challenges of understanding humanity (by paying close attention to how humans in two religious traditions have defined and narrated the relationship between rational and revealed thought) and seeking peace (by attending to how a nineteenth-century narrative of a timeless conflict between science and religion has distorted our understanding of the past and continues to undermine contemporary debates on their compatibility).	0	0
235	235	CCOL-UH	1004	Migration: 20th- and 21st-Century Stories and Images	(Formerly CCOL-AD 5)With visual images, like those of master photographer Sebastião Salgado; Edward Said’s Reflections on Exile and Other Essays; filmmaker Sarah Gavron’s adaptation of Monica Ali’s novel Brick Lane; and the stories of Ghassan Kanafani, such as the brilliant “Returning to Haifa,” artists have been attempting to tell the stories of contemporary migration: the forces that lead to emigration and exile, the immigrant experience, and the pain of trying to go home again. This course will be an exploration of visual art, film, theater, literature and essays that attempt to illuminate the immigrant journey and will give students the opportunity to tell their own stories of migration using a variety of media.	0	0
236	236	CCOL-UH	1005	Wellness, Illness, and Everything in Between	Please Check One That Best Describes Your Current Status: □ Healthy □ Ill □ Healing. Can this survey be answered accurately? This course focuses on how these states are defined personally, culturally, biologically, and clinically. Laying a foundation in the biological basis of illness and wellness, the course also considers cultural and social issues that impact disease susceptibility, treatment, and outcome. Students will explore how data are used to construct evidence-based best practices for clinical care and will discuss how these can be implemented across a range of societies. Two of the most pressing global health concerns – cancer and obesity – will serve as primary case studies to be examined from scientific and cultural perspectives. Assignments and class discussions will include clinical studies, documentaries, and readings that highlight how globalization and diverse cultural contexts have influenced the prevalence and treatment of these conditions. Students will acquire an informed perspective on the scientific, medical, and cultural issues surrounding wellness and illness and the medical practices that aim to heal the sick and “above all, do no harm.”	0	0
237	237	CCOL-UH	1006	Conserving Our Global Heritage through Science	What is “global heritage”? Is it simply our collective legacy as human societies – how we want to be remembered by future generations – or must we confront more difficult questions about identity, the ownership of culture, and conflicts between local and global stewardship of the cultural treasures and historical evidence? With time, negligence, and even military conflict working to erase the past, we must ask: Can a better understanding of our shared heritage assist us in addressing cultural differences in the present day? And how can science both help us understand the historic record and work to preserve it? This class examines ways in which scientific methods can help define “global heritage” and protect it for future generations. Students explore the history and the science behind the creation of paintings, frescoes, parchments, sculptures, ancient mummies, historical buildings, musical instruments, and other artifacts. They will also examine the methods used to differentiate between an authentic object and a fake and ask how some objects come to be valued more than others: distinctions that can lead, and have led, to cultural conflict in recent years.	0	0
238	238	CCOL-UH	1007	What Do Leaders Do?	Are social outcomes primarily shaped by prominent individuals or deterministic structural forces? Some claim leadership is a mere label used to justify social change stemming from structural forces of nature and culture. Others assert history can be found in the biographies of a few prominent men and women. In this course we examine this old and unsettled debate. Considering political, social, artistic, and business perspectives, we dissect the concept of leadership. Students will learn to elaborate on the interplay between culture and leadership and to what extent societies create their own leaders. The course draws on the work of classic and modern thinkers. We will also explore the life of prominent individuals, such as Mandela, Mother Teresa, Jobs, Soros, Churchill, Thatcher, Sheikh Zayed, among many others. Students will develop a conceptual framework to link leadership and some of our most pressing global challenges, such as inequality, sustainability, peace, and understanding humanity.	0	0
239	239	CCOL-UH	1008	Reading the Earth	This course introduces students to a wide variety of cultural perspectives on the ways that nature is conceived in its relation to human agency, social organization, and political behavior. As we become increasingly caught up in a new and ever-changing dynamic of climate change that is transforming cultures and societies globally, understanding our relation to nature becomes a pressing global challenge. How are we to confront the environmental changes caused by industrialization and continuing technological change? How have our views of nature and of ourselves been transformed by urbanization and technological change? Does the global character of production inevitably lead to the dilution of individual and local identities together with previous conceptions of nature? Constructed around a series of discrete problems that will be contextualized historically and culturally, the course strives for a unifying, global perspective on the environmental crisis and will address a range of today’s most pressing eco-critical dilemmas.	0	0
240	240	CCOL-UH	1009	Subjectivity	(Formerly CCOL-AD 10)Human beings differ from machines, and perhaps also from other animals, in the way we encounter the world – always from a first-personal perspective, an awareness of oneself in the world and not merely an acknowledgement of the world. But what exactly is this peculiarly distinctive way of experiencing the world? What is the essence of our subjectivity? Can it be explained by neuroscience, locating some particular function of the brain or “neural correlate”? Has it been better represented in the humanities, in explorations of “the human condition”? Or perhaps the philosophers, who in every age and culture have reflected on the nature of the self more than any other single topic, have had something valuable to say? We will study important ancient thinkers from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Greek, Christian and Jaina intellectual cultures, looking critically at their appeal to metaphors of light, of mirrors, and of interior spaces; at expressions of contemporary subjectivity in modern novelists and film-makers including Fernando Pessoa and Andrei Tarkovsky; and at dissenters from William Hazlitt to Simone Weil, who have said that subjectivity is merely an illusion – or, worse, a deceit.	0	0
241	241	CCOL-UH	1010	Future of Medicine	One of the biggest challenges in medicine is to prevent disease and ensure personalized treatment. This is now becoming possible thanks to high-resolution DNA sequencing technology that can decipher our individual information. These developments are already impacting global health, but they raise global challenges such as equality. How will these new technologies blend into healthcare systems? What regulations are needed to ensure that personalized medicine reaches all layers of society? How do we prevent discrimination based on our genes? Through an inquiry-based approach we will examine the science, economics, and politics behind medicine and evaluate the ethical issues that arise in this fast-developing field.	0	0
242	242	CCOL-UH	1012	Water: Rights and Resources	From space, there is no view of Earth without blue – water is everywhere.  From the ground however, there are many places – and many times – where there isn’t enough to go around.  Water is critical to our bodies, to the growth of our food, and to flushing away the wastes of human, economic, and industrial development.  However, as the number of human feet on the planet increases and their economic footprints grow, the sliver of Earth’s water that is available to us is spread thinner, and the distinction between water as a human need and right, and water as a scarce and precious resource, is blurred.  To understand how to manage water in a way that respects both its scarcity (managing for efficiency) and the needs of those who use it (managing for equity), it is important to understand the myriad modes and scales through which water shapes the world we live in.	0	0
243	243	CCOL-UH	1013	Colonialism and Postcolonialism	Until very recently much of the world has lived under colonial rule. Major colonial powers shaped social, religious, and institutional life in countries that they controlled. This course explores the legacies of colonial rule. In it, students encounter the markedly different perspectives of the colonizers and the colonized and ask whether these can be reconciled both historically and in the context of more contemporary postcolonial discourse. Asking how colonial practices have shaped the causes of global inequality and have influenced the dynamics of recent conflicts, the class also engages with the notion of justice in postcolonial contexts and asks whether former colonizers might have contemporary obligations toward their former subjects. This is a multidisciplinary course drawing on sources from the social sciences, history, and literature.	0	0
244	244	CCOL-UH	1014	Justice in Theory and Practice	(Formerly CCOL-AD 14)This course engages with historical and contemporary thinking about a global challenge: justice. Its scope is both global and firmly grounded in the experience of the NYUAD community and the United Arab Emirates more broadly. The course explores five key questions: 1. What makes individual action just? 2. Which solidarities, rights, and autonomy must a just polity protect? 3. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? What sorts of liberties? 4. What sort of justice are economic institutions bound to provide? 5. What systems of global justice exist? What should their scope comprise? How can we work to approach global justice in our local institutions?Students will approach these questions through historical and contemporary theories of justice from Plato and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to Marx and Engels, Qutb, and Ambedkar. Discussions will draw on both qualitative and quantitative methods to understand, analyze, and communicate about ways to approach ideals of justice in the context of local institutions. Throughout the course, students will engage in participatory action research to improve access to justice here in the UAE.	0	0
245	245	CCOL-UH	1015Q	Labor	How has labor – and our attitude towards it – evolved from subsistence farming and slavery? What happened in the industrial revolution and what further changes have been brought about in the new digital age? What role have institutions and religions played in attitudes toward labor? How does education affect work/life satisfaction, wages, and mobility? Why do so many people choose not to work “in the market,” and at the same time, why in happiness surveys is job loss often ranked similar in severity to the death of a close relative or divorce? These are some of the questions students will discuss in this class as they study how the roles of and attitudes towards labor have changed.	0	0
246	246	CCOL-UH	1016Q	Cooperation	How can we best address global challenges such as promoting peace and environmental sustainability? Hardly a week goes by without a major news story concerning the need for cooperation either between countries, political parties, organizations, or individuals. This course explores the topic of cooperation using insights from economics, evolutionary biology, mathematics, social psychology, and anthropology. The main questions to be addressed are: When is cooperation desirable? When should an individual, an organization, or a country expect others to cooperate? Why do some people fail to cooperate even when it would be to their benefit? Which factors undermine cooperation? How can we engineer cooperation to achieve better outcomes?	0	0
247	247	CCOL-UH	1017	Reimagining Nature	(Formerly CCOL-AD 17)For the first time in human history, the weather is about us. Growing scientific evidence of catastrophic – and anthropogenic – climate change brings new urgency to an old question: how do we humans conceive of our relationship to “nature”? This course explores how imaginative writers have situated the human in relation to Earth’s many landscapes, plants, climates, and species. How have they depicted meaningful encounters between humans and the other animals? What have they suggested about humans’ responsibilities to the countless other living beings with whom we share this planet? How have they “mapped” the slippery and shifting conceptual ground that lies between the “man-made” and the “natural”? And how might a renewed engagement with this vast theme help us deal with the heavy weather ahead? Readings include Gilgamesh, Genesis, The Bacchae, Narrow Road to the North, Walden, Island of Dr. Moreau, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and Life of Pi.	0	0
248	248	CCOL-UH	1018	Global Health Inequalities	(Formerly CCOL-AD 18)Health inequalities count among the primary global challenges facing our contemporary world. But how should we understand their underlying causes? What is their relationship to processes of globalization? And what institutions and practices should be established and supported to best address them? Debates over these questions are fierce, reflecting a wide range of cultural understandings, economic interests, ecological endowments, and ethical positions. By considering case studies drawn from Asia, Africa, South and North America, and Europe, this course explores the heated politics of answering these questions. Given today’s predominance of Global Health programs that aim to universalize evidence-based medicine (EBM) and to deliver public health via randomized control trials (RCTs), particular attention is paid to assessing these approaches from the vantage of their “target populations.”	0	0
249	249	CCOL-UH	1019	Extinction	Evidence suggests that our planet is currently experiencing the onset of a sixth mass extinction. (The fifth, caused by a meteor collision, occurred 65 million years ago.) Just recently, experts recommended that scientists recognize and declare a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, to mark the massive impact of human activities (and human-induced extinctions) on its biosphere. But how might we make sense of this era’s accelerating rate of species death? Is there a connection between the extinction of a species and the extinction of cultures, languages, and lifeways? And how have biodiversity loss, language death, the vanishing of “savage races” and aboriginal populations, genocide, and the specter of self-extinction shaped our understanding of what it means to be human? This course examines the human encounter with biotic, cultural, and metaphorical extinctions through a variety of genres, from Darwin’s reflections aboard the Beagle to the preservation of Ishi (“the last wild Indian”) and from flood narratives to apocalyptic fantasies.	0	0
250	250	CCOL-UH	1020	Water	Water is the life blood of existence. Across time and place it has sustained society, nourished crops, made war, diffused networks of trade and cultural exchange, delimited political jurisdictions, and powered machines. Whether tranquil, in motion, or in modes of manipulation, water has also inspired many worlds of artistic practice. This course uses examples from the visual and performing arts to highlight the subject of water as element, energy, human right, bridge between cultures, and instrument of war. Films include Drowned Out by Arundhati Roy, Even the Rain by Icíar Bollaín, Water by Deepa Mehta, and Black Water. Performing arts include plays such as Fire on the Water, a fast-paced series of short plays inspired by a pivotal moment in Cleveland’s history created by diverse playwrights; Water by the Spoonful by Quiara Alegría Hudes; and The Water Carriers by Michael Williams. These works highlight representations of water, the technologies deployed to shape such representations, and their larger role in illuminating big questions about the human condition.	0	0
251	251	CCOL-UH	1021	The Desert	The desert has been imagined as a barrier, a dry ocean, a bridge, and a hyphen between various ecological and cultural spaces across the globe. Drifting, parched tides of sand and vast, empty landscapes have made it seem uninhabitable and a metaphor for exile, difficult journeys, spiritual reflection, and death. This course explores the ways in which the desert has been depicted and experienced in various historical, cultural, and geographic contexts – from the Sahara to the Mojave, from the origins of Abrahamic religions to Burning Man, from desert oasis to urban food desert. This course will also consider the future of deserts and global challenges posed by climate change, desertification, and resources (water, oil, solar). Students will encounter the desert through diverse sources that include film, literature, soundscapes, musical performances, environmental and social history, artistic production, fieldtrips, and travel writings. So, even while the desert is an environmental reality that makes inhabitation difficult, it is still a space of demographic, cultural, and economic activity and exchange.	0	0
252	252	CCOL-UH	1022Q	Ethics and Politics of Public Health	(Formerly CCOL-AD 22Q)The media presents a flood of findings and recommendations about public health based on epidemiological studies, some of it contradictory to the last published findings. Then, many of these findings and resultant policies meet with vigorous, and even volatile, opposition from citizen-groups. This course will explore a complex question: How do historically powerful and enduring cultural influences (such as paternalism, racism, sexism, capitalism, ethnocentricity and “causation-ism”) contribute to volatile reactions to epidemiological findings and subsequent policy decisions designed to protect citizens in different countries today? Concepts from the fields of ethics, medical history, epidemiology, epistemology, and art will be central to readings, films, and discussions focused on addressing this core question.	0	0
253	253	CCOL-UH	1024Q	Life in the Universe	How did life form on Earth? How likely is it that life formed elsewhere in the universe? If it did, how can we find these beings? Was the formation of life in the universe a bygone conclusion? Answering these questions requires understanding the basics of biology, chemistry, and physics and has strong bearing on our understanding of the human condition and the sustainability of life on our planet. During this semester, students will discuss current models for how the necessary ingredients for life formed in the universe, the observational and experimental evidence for these theories, attempts by scientists and science fiction writers to imagine life in other parts of the universe, and the many questions which remain.	0	0
254	254	CCOL-UH	1025	Human Body	When looking at paintings of Rubens, pictures of fashion models, prehistoric Venus figurines or Greek sculptures, it is obvious that the appreciation for the human body has changed drastically through space and time. These differences of perception can generate inter-individual and cultural tensions and affect public policy, for example in the context of health care policy and equal opportunity in the work place. This course will examine how our understanding of human physiology, genetics, and development, as well as methods of investigations of human anatomy, have shaped the perception of the human body, through history, and across cultures. Students will examine the function of the body and how the understanding of bodily functions has changed (the working body). The course will also delve into the modifications the human body has experienced evolutionarily and how our own body is changing from a single cell until death (the changing body). Finally, it will examine deviations from the typical body plan and the causes for these deviations (the abnormal body). These topics will be explored using scientific and non-scientific literature, art, and movies.	0	0
255	255	CCOL-UH	1026	Migration	There are more migrants worldwide today than Brazil has inhabitants. China, India, and the Philippines are sending most migrants; the most important host areas are Europe and the United States; and expats make up more than 60% of the total population in Qatar and the UAE. How has migration been represented in and shaped by literature and art? This course reviews exemplary texts, striking images, and important films. It focuses on the United States from around 1880 to World War II and on Europe in the second half of the twentieth century, then opens up toward students’ examination of cultural work by and about contemporary migrants from around the world. Readings include autobiography, reportage, documentary photography and film as well as fiction and creative visual work. Among the topics for discussion are metaphors and theories of migration (from uprooting and bird-of-passage to expatriate and melting-pot); labor arrangements; scenes of departure, voyage, and arrival; vibrant migrant communities and migrant alienation and pain; negotiation between places of origin and of arrival.	0	0
256	256	CCOL-UH	1027	Privacy in a Digital Society	What is privacy, and how will our digital future change the ways we perceive and experience it – individually, as nations, and as a global society? We leave digital footprints on the Internet and in numerous everyday situations, with direct consequences on our privacy. These digital footprints are desirable in some cases, such as when we post pictures and comments in discussion forums and social networks. In other situations, the consequences of leaking information are less apparent, such as when we are tracked by carrying electronic devices or by the websites we visit. Personal data is increasingly becoming the new currency used to pay for services – consciously and unconsciously. In this colloquium, students sharpen their understanding of privacy in the digital age, discuss historic and various national views on privacy, form opinions on levels of desirable privacy, and develop a basic understanding of technical means to reach privacy goals, with a focus on their respective opportunities and limitations. Materials include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, court rulings, and Solove's taxonomy of privacy, along with technical and ethical discussions.	0	0
257	257	CCOL-UH	1028	Global Governance	How has the creation of structures and norms of global governance reshaped historical efforts at pacifying international relations, fostering economic development, and providing global public goods? Today, an expansive network of inter-governmental institutions exists, but global attempts to engage with poor, conflict-affected countries often struggle to meet local needs. This course examines global governance’s origins, logic, and varying impact in local contexts. Students will explore and debate different perspectives on global governance and develop a better understanding of how power, institutions, and cultural norms shape interactions between global and local actors. Case studies include successes and failures of international attempts at 1) post-conflict peacebuilding in Namibia, Somalia, and Afghanistan; 2) facilitating transitional justice in Liberia and Yugoslavia; and 3) addressing refugee crises in Mozambique and Syria. The course will help students to grapple with the complex political and ethical dilemmas of global governance and devise more effective and context-sensitive strategies for resolving some of the most pressing challenges of our time.	0	0
258	258	CCOL-UH	1029	Humanity and the Cosmos: Is There Room for Philosophy and Religion in a Scientific World?	Scientific development has gradually appropriated the explanatory domains once thought to be exclusive to philosophy and religion. Is there any role left, then, for philosophy and religion in a modern scientific world? How might reflection on this question allow us better to understand humanity’s place in the universe? This course will investigate these questions through the lens of physical cosmology, a discipline whose emergence has upended our perceived centrality in the universe. What lessons might cosmology have for philosophy, religion, and our general understanding of ourselves as human beings? We will consider the intellectual history of cosmology and its 20th-century transition into a modern scientific discipline, in addition to the contemporary frontiers of cosmological knowledge. Are there reasons to think the origins of the universe were “fine-tuned” for human existence, and does this create conceptual space for theological and philosophical considerations within modern science? Why is there something rather than nothing? Should we even think that cosmology (and science generally) is the appropriate tool for addressing existential questions about the nature of humanity?	0	0
259	259	CCOL-UH	1030	War	What is war? Why do wars exist? What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in processes of mourning in the aftermath of conflict. Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, students will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thucydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso, Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among others.	0	0
260	260	CCOL-UH	1031	Nature and Human Nature	The notion of “following nature” as a guide to human conduct is ages-old. So is the opposing contention that humanity should rise (but how?) above what nature has given us in order to grasp some higher destiny (but what?). What lies behind these opposing conceptions of the relationship between humanity and our natural environment? If we are shown to be nothing but animals of a particular sort, then what does that spell for our self-image, societal ideals, and ultimate end? And does our place in the natural order confer upon us some special duties with regard to the rest of nature? Finally, what notion of “natural” is operative behind these discussions, anyway? Is the notion of “human nature” even coherent, or particularly helpful? Students will examine psychology, society, morality, and religion, and approach these topics from the point of view of philosophy, literature, and science. Classical texts and cutting-edge research will deepen an understanding of the problem faced by us all – that of what it means to act naturally, and whether we should.	0	0
261	261	CCOL-UH	1032	Communication: from bacteria to humans	No organism on Earth lives in isolation! This simple fact underscores the importance of interactions between species. But how do organisms interact? What languages do they use? This course explores how interspecies crosstalk sustains life on Earth an d how challenges such as global warming influence such communication. Topics to discuss include the role of chemical communication between bacteria in causing infectious diseases and whether the overuse of antibiotics is sustainable; how communication between ocean algae coupled with global warming lead to recurrent “red tides”; the breakdown of coral-algae symbiosis and implications for coastal fisheries; disruption of the language bees use to maintain colonies and the rise of colony collapse disorder that threatens pollination globally; the potential use of plant language to combat bug infestation in lieu of pesticides; how our gut microbiota influence physical appearance and susceptibility to disease and whether our innate bacteria affect our social interactions; how human communication has influenced civilization and whether modern technological advances, such as social media, have positive or negative effects on us as a species.	0	0
262	262	CCOL-UH	1034	Gender	What is gender? What does it mean to be male or female across time and space? How can thinking about gender inform the analysis of texts, societies, and politics? This class will explore these questions by drawing on a wide range of sources from religion, science, Islamic and Jewish law, psychoanalysis, philosophy, art, history, and literature including Marquis de Sade, Freud, Virginia Woolf, Anton Chekhov, and the feminist revolutionary Alexandra Kollontai. Using these and other sources, we will investigate how gender is constructed in relation to race, class, morality, social justice, and other norms of “appropriate” social behavior in different contexts. The class will conclude by drawing on examples from contemporary advertising and media to discuss the relationships between gender and power, violence, the economy, and humor.	0	0
263	263	CCOL-UH	1035	Inequality	Inequality is a fundamental issue with which every human society, past and present, has had to deal. This course explores why inequality occurs and why it matters, questions which have taken on critical importance in this time of deepening global inequalities. The course will approach these questions by considering inequality in comparative and historical perspective so that students will gain a deeper perspective on today’s debates. While the course will focus on the wide-ranging consequences of inequality, particular emphasis will be placed on the relationship between inequality and government. How does governmental action influence inequality, and why? Does the presence of inequality influence what type of government is possible? To answer these questions the course will draw on sources from a range of academic disciplines including political science, history, economics, philosophy, and literature. However, no prior expertise in any of these areas will be required. By the end of the course students will be in a better position to formulate their own normative opinions about inequality while also understanding how it functions in practice.	0	0
264	264	CCOL-UH	1036	Postcolonial Memory: Representing Cultures of Displacement	“We are here because you were there” has become a common slogan for postcolonial diasporas in the metropolitan “centers” of the West. With the growing numbers of immigrants and refugees from the Middle East/North Africa in cities such as London, Paris, Berlin, Barcelona, New York, Los Angeles, Montreal, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and São Paulo, the construction of “us” versus “them” can no longer correspond to one geography, simplistically imagined as “over there.” This seminar will study questions of displacement as represented, mediated, and narrated in a wide variety of texts. It will focus especially on memoirs, whether in written or audiovisual form, which confront exclusionary and essentialist discourses with a rich cultural production that foregrounds a complex understanding of such issues as “home,” “homeland,” “exile,” “hybridity,” and “minorities.”	0	0
265	265	CCOL-UH	1038	Prejudice	“Prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future and renders the present inaccessible” – Maya Angelou. Every society in the world struggles with intergroup prejudice to some degree. This colloquium explores the antecedents and consequences of (and potential remedies for) intergroup prejudice through the lens of multiple disciplines, including history, social science, literature, and the arts. It considers the perspectives of the perpetrators, targets, and observers of prejudice and discrimination and explores the following topics: the origins of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression and their justifications, the conditions under which prejudice is exacerbated (or reduced), and the differential ways explicit and implicit prejudice manifests in individuals and institutions. We also discuss the burden of living in prejudicial societies, the social and psychological obstacles involved in acknowledging and confronting prejudice, and the costs associated with overcoming these obstacles.	0	0
266	266	CCOL-UH	1039	Animal Perspectives	Humans, across culture and time, have turned to animals to address fundamental questions in biology. Select species coined model organisms have been widely used to study development, behavior, evolution, disease, and recently to demystify cognition and perception. By anthropomorphizing non-human species, we create frameworks for understanding and relating to them. Animal research has also been essential to addressing the global challenges to preserve declining and endangered species. This course tackles a number of biological paradigms where the animal has been a central figure. What determines which animals we use as subjects in research? What are the ethical and moral implications of animal-based experiments? How have animal-based research discoveries been communicated in the scientific community and popular media? And how might we tackle environmental and conservation issues through a non-human lens? As a final project, students will choose an animal and explore its representation in scientific and artistic practices. Creating short films about these subjects, they will give the animals unique perspectives and an opportunity to speak back to us.	0	0
267	267	CCOL-UH	1040	Disability	This course considers disability as a cultural concept – not simply a medical condition or personal misfortune – that describes how human variation matters in the world. How has disability been understood over time and across cultures? How have disabled bodies been represented and classified? How does disability intersect with other identity formations such as race, class, and gender? Ultimately, we will ask: what new forms of representation might bodily difference produce, and what might the concept of disability teach us about all bodies? Alongside texts that may describe disability as defective or tragic, we will trace other literary possibilities for bodies and minds that resist normative structures, from narratives that theorize ideas of access, cure, and care to fictions that reclaim disability as enlivening identity.	0	0
268	268	CCOL-UH	1041	Atom and Energy	E=mc2: One simple equation encapsulates the power to grant life and death in equal measure – life associated with fusion in the sun, radiation therapy, and nuclear energy; death via nuclear bombs and nuclear disasters. This course uses nuclear physics as a prism for exploring science as a human endeavor, focusing on the physics of the atomic nucleus and its technological applications. Arguments for and against nuclear power plants are analyzed, while the power and threat of nuclear weapons are assessed. The international treaties designed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons are scrutinized, emphasizing the challenges that lawmakers and citizens face in determining and guiding the uses of nuclear power and grappling with the moral responsibility that all of us – scientists, politicians, and citizens – must bear for ourselves, our nations, and ultimately, for humanity.	0	0
269	269	CCOL-UH	1042	Multi-ethnic Democracy	Most democracies in the world are multi-ethnic. But the jury is still out on the question of what ethnic diversity means for democratic stability and governance. This course combines materials from across many disciplines, including political science, political philosophy, economics, mathematics, anthropology, history, and the humanities to address questions including the following: Does ethnic diversity – based on race, color, nationality, language, tribe, caste, religion, sect and region – constitute an obstacle or an asset for successful democracy? What are the goals of individuals who mobilize politically on the basis of one or more of these identities? What are the principles that democratic systems should employ in responding to identity-based claims? And how should we evaluate public policies designed to respond to such claims, including affirmative action, federalism, cultural rights, educational policies, and electoral systems? The aim is to train students to think critically and comparatively about the global and local challenges faced by multi-ethnic democracies, using a combination of primary and secondary materials and real-world examples drawn from across several countries.	0	0
270	270	CCOL-UH	1043X	Religion, Revolution, Media	Can a better understanding of religion and media lead to superior analysis of their deepening interaction in contemporary globalization? Media history is frequently framed as revolutionary, e.g. “the print revolution” or “the information revolution.” But revolution is a word with its own history, including religious implications, whether as inaugurating a new order of the ages, novus ordo saeclorum (see the Great Seal of the United States, est. 1782), or as a cycle of time, of conservation and restoration, to invoke revolution’s older, astronomical meaning. As religious politics comes to the fore in contexts as varied as South Asia, the Middle East, and the United States, and movements such as Christian Evangelism and Islamism gain global momentum, some historical stock-taking is due. To understand the media’s role in contemporary global conflict, including the interplay of religiosity and media-led mobilization, students will examine a range of materials and situations, from the use of religion in and beyond the U.S. as an ally against “godless Communism,” to the world-wide flaring up of religious politics as the Cold War ended, to our immediate geopolitical contexts.	0	0
271	271	CCOL-UH	1044	Contagion	How do we respond to news that some among us are ill, and that the illness is, perhaps, contagious? Are the healthy ethically obliged to tend to the sick? What are the relationships between “communicable” disease and verbal communication: rumors, medical information, stories about the dying and the dead? How has illness literally and metaphorically participated in the reimagination of community, kinship, and sexuality in different times and places? This multidisciplinary course examines the intersections of contagious disorder and storytelling in a range of cultures, settings, and forms, from ancient Greece to contemporary South Africa, from the Black Death, influenza, and AIDS to the proliferation of zombies and vampires in global popular culture today.	0	0
272	272	CCOL-UH	1045	Axes of Evil	What is evil? We use the term to describe human behavior, political regimes, natural disasters, and epidemic disorder. The idea of evil is as old as humanity, and various religious, legal, political, and social arrangements aim to circumvent it. But definitions vary over time and across cultures, suggesting that evil may be contextual rather than universal. If so, can we say that evil is a constitutive part of the human condition? This colloquium offers a multi-disciplinary investigation into evil’s dimensions and its implications for peace, justice, and human understanding. It begins with the theological conundrum all major religions face: how to reconcile the evils of human suffering with the existence of a loving god. Additional topics include the concept of evil as a rationale for colonial and imperial projects; the Nazi use of gas chambers during WWII; and the Aversion Project in South Africa. Students will examine attempts to prevent evil, venturing into the realm of clinical psychology with the psychopathic serial killer and exploring Marx’s indictment of capitalism’s evils by considering alternatives to corporations’ pursuit of profit at the expense of ordinary people.	0	0
273	273	CCOL-UH	1046	Women and Leadership	Do women lead differently than men? What are the implications of women’s and men’s unequal distribution in leadership across many social domains? This course examines past and present challenges and opportunities related to women and leadership, empowerment, equality, and gender equity from a global perspective. In doing so it seeks to examine critically the historical contexts and conditions within which issues of women and leadership have been embedded. What are the effects of inequality, injustice, and discrimination on women’s underrepresentation in leadership across the world? The course will take a variety of disciplinary approaches to the topic, drawing on autobiographies, biographies, novels, films, and TV series, alongside academic literature.	0	0
274	274	CCOL-UH	1048	Statehood	States form the building blocks of our global order, significantly impacting how people from diverse countries, cultures, and regional backgrounds interact with each other. Yet what does the concept of statehood entail and what is its role in a globalized world? The course examines the historical, legal, political, and cultural foundations of the concepts of state and statehood, along with related ideas, such as sovereignty, citizenship, and statelessness. A diverse range of literary, cultural, legal, and government sources will help create the course’s conceptual framework as well as case studies of past and present challenges to state-building efforts. Examples will include state-building in the Global South, various forms of regional cooperation (e.g. the GCC, ASEAN, etc.), and the creation of supranational institutions such as the European Union. In addition, the course will examine questions of statehood/statelessness during times of war and conflict, and in relation to topics such as migration and refugees, social movements, gender, race and ethnicity, and civil and human rights.	0	0
275	275	CCOL-UH	1049	State of the Nation	This colloquium examines the increasingly urgent global challenge posed by radical forms of nationalism. Beginning with the nation-state’s origin and logic and extending to contemporary notions of citizenship across the globe, students will draw on disciplines such as history, politics, economics, anthropology, and cultural studies to ask: What makes an individual a citizen? Are nations and states synonymous? Do nations require cultural unity? Focusing on how colonialism and neo-colonialism have shaped the emergence of modern nations, the seminar trains special attention on the Arab world. How did early Arab writers represent other nations before the nation-state? How do Western views of nation-state interact with local understandings of tribe, umma (Muslim people), or community? Historical and theoretical frames range from the Prophet Muhammad’s vision for the Islamic umma to Plato’s polis, from Benedict Anderson’s account of imagined community to Arab socialist adaptations of Marx and Lenin, from oil’s impact on notions of citizenship and Arabness in Gulf states to the global refugee crisis that threatens international stability and human rights today.	0	0
276	276	CCOL-UH	1050	Transnational Feminisms	What are possibilities for feminist solidarity across borders, given deep and abiding divisions (such as class, race, sexuality, geography, and history) among women? How do transnational frameworks recast our understanding of feminism(s), and of the forces that shape women’s lives “here” and “elsewhere”? How are histories of capitalism, colonialism, and slavery important for understanding contemporary connections among women across national and other borders? This course explores these and other questions, with a focus on the intersecting transnational forces that produce gendered and sexualized bodies, practices, and discourses. It examines the ways the politics of gender and sexuality intersect with the politics of nationalism, neoliberalism, empire, the role of the United Nations, and religious radicalism in its various forms. Course material will include both empirical and theoretical texts from a range of disciplines and geographical areas. Throughout, students will assess possibilities for reconciling scholarship with activism, given the distinctly different responses of activists and scholars to concepts such as cultural relativism, liberal rights regimes, and female agency.	0	0
277	277	CCOL-UH	1051	Accidental Equality	Can equality be produced by accident? Research shows that even planned egalitarianism is disadvantaged prematurely by prejudicial frameworks. But what about egalitarian structures that happen by accident – for example, a class that is diverse without intentional curation, or a gender-equal firm with no feminist intention? How do we make sense of these outcomes? Is such representation and parity the same thing as equality? Using examples from historical accounts (Alexvich), contemporary ethnography (Boo, Ballakrishnen), mythology (Ramayana, Mahabharata), and fiction (Bui, Unnikrishnan), this seminar will dissect the potential for (and coordinates of) “accidental” equality, especially in sites where its evidence seems unlikely. Grounding our inquiry will be tools from radical political thought, gender studies, sociology, and critical legal theory. To the extent the potential for accidental equality might be hiding in plain sight, students will – as they unearth it – consider the ultimate reward of hope as a radical praxis as well as the importance of subjective voice in enabling its discovery.	0	0
278	278	CCOL-UH	1052X	Art of Revolution	Can aesthetic forms promote and not just respond to revolutionary social and political change? This Core Colloquium confronts global challenges of peace, justice, and equality by examining the role of music and other art forms in advancing social movements, using the recent history of the Middle East and North Africa as a principal case study. Placing these events in a longer historical context, course materials will explore what role the arts have played in social movements, including 20th-century revolutions in Egypt, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Palestinian Intifadas, and the Arab Uprisings. Students will ask how artistic practices not only reflect social changes in these case studies, but also promote them. Drawing on theoretical readings on aesthetics, social movements, and revolution from disciplines including anthropology, musicology, and Middle East Studies, students will develop a critical understanding for the role of art in social change, an analytical grasp of theories of social mobilization, and deeper knowledge of recent historical moments in the Middle East and North Africa region.	0	0
279	279	CCOL-UH	1053	Calamity and Creation	While natural disasters–floods, earthquakes, and outbreaks of infectious diseases–have devastated human communities over the centuries, they have also often led to significant advances in the arts. From some of our earliest mythologies to the contemporary struggle with global climate change, the expressive and performing arts have helped us to understand the magnitude of catastrophes, both natural and man-made, as well as to shape our responses to them. How can we better understand this intimate relationship among catastrophe and creative expression? How have artists responded historically to catastrophic events? What aesthetic strategies do artists develop to make large-scale catastrophes tangible on a human level? What role do the arts and expressive culture play in debates–scientific, governmental, economic–on natural and man-made disasters? What can such expression tell us about ourselves as humans? Students will read primary historical texts and engage with artistic responses to catastrophe, ranging from literature and painting to music, drama, and cinema.	0	0
280	280	CCOL-UH	1054	Between Faith and Unbelief	What is religious faith? How is it found, inherited, lost, or questioned? If one questions faith, does that amount to unbelief? Or are faith and unbelief two sides of the same coin? These questions have appeared in the writing and living of scholars, saints, politicians, and laypeople in various traditions. Individuals, religious institutions, and political authorities have sought to cultivate, monitor, compel, or prohibit expressions of religious faith and unbelief in different ways. Thus questions about faith and unbelief have inspired works of art as well as political crises that prompt national and even global concern about peace, justice, and equality. This colloquium explores the study of religious faith by listening to those who find faith alongside those who lose or question it. We bring some classic texts in the study of religion together with film, poetry, biography, ethnography, and history to explore the lives of Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Jews in India, Ethiopia, Britain, Turkey, and Iran. What are the consequences for the prospects of peace, justice, and equality in the twenty-first century when the lines between faith and unbelief are drawn or blurred?	0	0
281	281	CCOL-UH	1055	Oil	Oil is obviously a matter of huge importance in Abu Dhabi and globally. But what is oil? Is it a mineral formed by long-decayed microorganisms or volcanic activity? Is it a source of power (the fuel derived by cracking it into gasoline)–or a source of geopolitical power? Does oil bring wealth–or, as some researchers argue, a “resource curse”? What is oil for Arab states? For the planet? And what happens if or when it runs out? This Core Colloquium addresses these and many related issues from multidisciplinary and global perspectives, drawing on materials and concepts from geology, history, political economy, film, and literature.	0	0
282	282	CCOL-UH	1056EQ	Fairness	What is fair and what is unfair? Is fairness universal? Are equality and fairness synonyms? How can we build a fairer world? Anyone can recall a situation when someone exclaimed, “That’s not fair!” Whether arguing with your roommate about the upkeep of common areas, viewing the daily news, or analyzing fiscal policies, people often disagree on what constitutes a fair process or outcome. The plurality of fairness ideals may lead to a breakdown in negotiations, social conflict, or other undesirable outcomes. Social stability is at risk when systems are perceived as unfair. Potential business partners may fail to collaborate if they cannot agree on a compensation system that properly rewards efforts and employees may withhold labor or even sabotage production if they feel treated unfairly. On the upside, a shared sense of fairness may lead to mutually beneficial interactions, social cohesion, and smooth political decision-making processes. This Colloquium draws from disciplines including philosophy, psychology, political science, economics, and organizational behavior to question our own notions and judgments and arrive at a holistic understanding of fairness as a concept.	0	0
283	283	CCOL-UH	1057	Situated Self: Self and Relation to Others	As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, we must ask new questions about who we are as individuals (Self), in geographical and ideological spaces (Setting), and in relation to those, often different from ourselves, we encounter—physically, virtually, or otherwise (Situation). Any attempt at establishing peace, equality, justice, health, or sustainable environments depends on how we approach such questions. What are the bases of our identities? How do they intersect and shift? How can we understand our culturally influenced perspectives in ways that contribute to a collective future? This course draws on scholarship and conceptual models across the humanities, sociology, women’s and gender studies, and organizational psychology to ask how various critical and disciplinary approaches to self, self vs. other, and self vs. system may serve to disrupt uninterrogated bias and encourage the perspectives necessary for effective intercultural understanding. Engaging especially with theories of performativity and intersectionality, this colloquium asks how self-understanding affects the way we approach both immediate social situations and our most pressing global challenges.	0	0
284	284	CCOL-UH	1058	Journeys	This colloquium takes as its touchstone the idea that movement, actual and imaginative, has historically generated knowledge and sharpened our ethical sensibilities. Drawing on literature, film, and theory across disciplines, historical periods, and geographic fields, it explores how journeys—and associated experiences such as pilgrimage, nomadism, adventure, slavery, imperialism, migration, exile, commerce, tourism, and climate change—provide narrative frames for human inquiry. What is the difference between travels and journeys? What difference does it make, then, when journeys are chosen vs. forced? How might depictions of journeys enact representational and even physical power and inequality over those they survey? How do journeys transform individual and group senses of self, others, home, and the world? How do encounters with unknown places and others prompt questions about comparison, difference, commensurability, and co-existence? What roles might translation and adaptation play in this process? Such questions suggest that journeys provide much more than the discovery of destinations and may, in fact, facilitate self-discovery in unexpected ways.	0	0
285	285	CCOL-UH	1059Q	Quantified Self	Self-tracking. Biohacking. Personal informatics. Quantified self. The contemporary “quantified self” movement makes claims of “self-knowledge through numbers” and improving health and human welfare. There are clearly other elements to self-tracking culture that deserve critical investigation. What does the self become through the lens of data? What is the dark side of data that can be used against us, and without regard for social justice and equality? This multidisciplinary course takes both a theoretical and a practical look at the pressing issue of data aggregation about human beings. It looks to the past for historical forms of self-quantification and to the future of a rapidly expanding globalized landscape of app tracking and wearable technologies. With the question of human data in mind, the course examines the unsure futures of humanity in a variety of domains: medicine and aging, education, the arts, marketing, and the Internet of Things. Students will situate themselves critically within this increasingly dense data landscape by creating data about themselves that can be analyzed and interpreted using a variety of data visualization and storytelling frameworks.	0	0
286	286	CCOL-UH	1060	What Is Secularism?	Inspired by the French Enlightenment, “secularism” has come to represent non-religious approaches to morality and socio-political life. This course draws on multiple disciplines—including history, philosophy, fine arts, and political science—to explore secularism’s multiple meanings and manifestations. Does secularism have core values and, if so, how do those differ from religious values? What are secularism’s origins, and is it fundamentally Western? How do philosophical approaches commonly associated with secularism (e.g., humanism, agnosticism, and atheism) differ, and how have such paradigms influenced knowledge-production and human rights norms? In addition to exploring these far-reaching questions, students will compare the specificities of secular mobilization and governance worldwide: How does secular governance in China and Russia differ from models in the United States, France, India, and Turkey? Is there a positive correlation between secularization and economic development, increased religious diversity, or broader access to education? What interrelationships exist between secularization and democratization? Is any contemporary society truly secular?	0	0
287	287	CCOL-UH	1061	Water for Life	Water is fundamental to life and to fundamental human rights such as adequate food and livelihood. Water’s availability and quality have shaped civilizations; its place in our contemporary lives bears on global societal issues such as health, food security, gender equality, and economic policy. Despite making up most of the Earth’s surface, water remains a precious resource to which billions of people have little or no access. This colloquium takes a multidisciplinary approach to the connections between water and society, including scientific, social, and economic perspectives. How does the availability of safe drinking water relate to health and sanitation? How are water, food, and energy linked? In what ways do human actions affect water-related ecosystems? What role does the water industry play in job creation? What recent advances have been made in water harvesting and desalination? Learning to weigh and synthesize multiple forms of evidence, students will develop the skills needed to address these and other questions and challenges posed with respect to water and society.	0	0
288	288	CCOL-UH	1062	Conviction and Doubt	This course explores the role of conviction and doubt in our efforts at understanding society and our place in it. While conviction may provide the scaffolding of a life, a community, and a worldview, doubt often plays an integral part in wrestling firmly held beliefs toward new invention and discovery. The history of doubt coincides with the history of the idea of the self (as individuals) and our individual relationship to others, within and beyond our immediate communities. The course will track the evolution of this idea through essays, literature, art installations, podcasts, television broadcasts, maps, poetry, and film. How do tensions between conviction and doubt structure the stories we tell and the narratives we create in various artistic domains? Students will learn to examine specific works through the lens of dramatic principles that drive polarities (either/or) toward greater plurality and complexity. In turn, students will investigate pluralism and a more complex worldview in light of the resources and mindset needed for meeting the global challenges in today’s world.	0	0
289	289	CCOL-UH	1063	Ethics and Activism	What is empathy? Does it aid or complicate activism? Does it influence scholarly activities such as ethnography? Working among communities, whether as scholars, journalists, human rights workers, or health care practitioners, requires grappling with positions or persons one may find sympathetic—or not. Either perspective is multidimensional, complicated because such work requires spending extended time with interlocutors. Fieldworkers must generate rapport, empathy, and intimacy with their subjects—but without losing objectivity. The ethics of such encounters hinge both on doing no harm and on doing good—through advocacy, opposition, or expressions that are not so straightforward. Doing no harm is a clear-cut ethical imperative. But do empathy, intimacy, and approval fall within the same categorical imperative? What happens when boundaries break down between researcher and subject, sympathy and ambivalence, rapport and incompatibility? This Colloquium explores exemplary cases from across the globe, giving particular attention to the production of knowledge—as text and as “activism” that engages the ambiguities and conventions that structure our societies and lived experience.	0	0
290	290	CCOL-UH	1064	Can Cultural Traditions Endure?	What defines artistic and cultural traditions? How do they occur, develop, and transmit? What roles do they play in forming or preserving cultural identities? What is their value for the future? What is lost when traditions end? Are they sustainable? This multidisciplinary colloquium considers the nature of “tradition” in art and culture, through time and across the globe. We will study how ideas, beliefs, aspirations, and imagination coalesce to form traditions and how traditions take shape, forming purpose and power. How do socio-political, economic, religious and, environmental factors affect the formation, evolution, and preservation of traditions? How do materials, content, concepts, principles, constructs, conventions, and aesthetics help perpetuate meaning? Can traditions merge, overlap, or spawn new traditions? By examining how various traditions have structured and impacted human thought, expression, and experience, students will investigate traditions’ practical workings as well as their theoretical underpinnings, as a means to determine their local and global value–in the past, today, and for the future.	0	0
291	291	CCOL-UH	1065	Resentment and Politics	Across the globe, political conflict is increasingly defined by the notion of resentment–defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as a “sense of grievance; an indignant sense of injury or insult received or perceived; (a feeling of) ill will, bitterness, or anger against a person or thing.” In this Core Colloquium, we will endeavor together to better understand the role of resentment in politics. How should we define resentment, and how universal is this concept across cultures and nations? What tools or approaches can we use to assess its impact on contemporary political events? What are the relationships between resentment and desired end-states like equality, justice, and reconciliation? Course materials will include philosophical explorations, primary sources, conceptual mappings and empirical research on resentment. Students will also engage in basic data analyses exploring the causes and consequences of resentment worldwide.	0	0
292	292	CCOL-UH	1069	Global Language: Communication and Conflict	In our globalizing age, a handful of languages—English, French, Spanish, and in some regions Russian, Arabic, and Mandarin—are becoming “world languages,” used internationally and widely acquired as second languages. Since human communities always develop some common medium of communication, this reflects the emergence of transnational or global communities. But it also reflects and ratifies disparities of power, privileging nations and native speakers of the world languages and disadvantaging non-speakers. Has globalization of language, like globalization in other domains, produced disruption, contention, and conflict? What about the other six thousand or so human languages, and the billions of people who do not speak a world language? Minority languages are becoming endangered or extinct; educational failure and economic exclusion are widespread among those forced to function in unfamiliar tongues. This course explores such challenges, including language maintenance and shift, language politics, multilingual education, cultural and personal identity, and linguistic human rights.	0	0
293	293	CCOL-UH	1070	Hindsight	How does the “benefit of hindsight” shape the stories that define our sense of self? Do these stories change depending on what is important to us at the time of looking back This multidisciplinary colloquium brings together the study of psychology, philosophy, sociology, history, and literary memoir to explore how autobiographical memories may be structured less by weighing evidence than by rules of employment and the need to create a morally comprehensible narrative identity. What roles do dominant narratives constructed within different socio-cultural worlds play in shaping individuals’ narrative identities? And what happens when dominant narratives are created globally and no longer the preserve of regional societies? Whose interests might such identity-conferring narratives serve? What happens when globalizing cultures create tension between collective memories of belonging (to communities/nations) and autobiographies that foreground exceptionality, individual achievement, and cosmopolitan engagement? What are the psychological consequences of “looking back” on one’s life from a critical moral perspective? And what are the implications for “understanding humanity”?	0	0
294	294	CCOL-UH	1071	Price of Luxury	What distinguishes a luxury from a necessity? How do we know luxury when we see it? Luxury goods range from art and handbags to automobiles, vintage vines and rare animal species, and many others items. Such goods have played important roles in the history of civilizations, triggering wars and financial crises or defining political and religious values. Luxury is also like a pioneer, making important steps for the first time, allowing mankind to develop its capabilities and expressing this development. In fact, the dynamic of “luxury” predates humans and figures in the behavior of mammals. Today, luxury goods are hardly reserved for the wealthiest, which devote nearly 65% of their consumption to such items, since low-income families (the bottom fifth of earners) also spend about 40% on luxuries and 60% on necessities. How does such behavior factor into a pursuit of just societies? How does it play out in everyday decision-making? Students in this multidisciplinary colloquium will examine the history, pricing, cost, and present state of luxury goods across societies and will learn to use scientific methods to envision the roles that luxury goods might play in humanity’s future.	0	0
295	295	CCOL-UH	1072	Tolerance	Most of us agree that we should be tolerant of the beliefs and practices of others. Often the call for tolerance is grounded in some form of relativism—that is, in the thought that there simply isn’t an absolute or objective fact of the matter. After all, on what basis could we insist that others share our beliefs if those beliefs are subjective in some way, a function of our upbringing, our religion, our social norms, our culture, or our own peculiar tastes and concerns? But what reasons do we have to accept some such form of relativism? Can relativism really ground our commitment to tolerance? If not, then how else can we justify that commitment? We will explore these questions as they arise in a number of different philosophical and religious traditions. Readings will be drawn from both classical and contemporary sources and will include the work of anthropologists, literary and political theorists, philosophers, and theologians.	0	0
296	296	CCOL-UH	1073	Government: Theory and Practice	This course covers the foundations of government and government policies mixing theory and empirical evidence. Understanding government requires to consider its political, economic and social role and hence it is a multidisciplinary enterprise. We mostly rely on the literature on Philosophy, Economics, Institutions and Political Science. We consider the role of the State in society, the salient relevance of property rights for capitalists’ societies and the role of the State in its enforcement as well as on provide justice and equity. We also consider the conflict of interest in societies and how it affects institutions and policies as well as reforms. We also consider the role of experts in designing policy. Finally, we discuss the role of governments and institutions in the process of sustainable development. The distressing effects of corruption as well as its causes are also analyzed. In class we will rely on a vast academic literature but also on the policy experience of the instructor who served as Deputy Minister at Treasury in Argentina and advised governments around the world. In addition to a vast academic literature assigned as main readings, students will be assigned journalist pieces related to each topic for class discussion.	0	0
297	297	CCOL-UH	1074	Industrial Revolutions and the Future of Work	"How has the automation economy changed the ways we live and work? What challenges and opportunities does automation pose for the future? This multidisciplinary colloquium draws on materials in social science, science, and the humanities to explore how societies have organized themselves relative to technology in the past, and what changes are currently taking place. As we are now in the midsts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, what lessons can be learned from its predecessors? What consequences might new technologies pose for global challenges such as peace, education, equality, or sustainable development? How does the very definition of the ""human"" stand to be affected? Students will examine the wave of technology-driven transformations occurring on a global scale, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and virtual reality. They will consider the Fourth Industrial Revolution as an opportunity to critique theories of technological change and construct their own narratives of change in individual case study analysis assignments."	0	0
298	298	CCOL-UH	1075	Body Politics	The body plays a central role in today’s global challenges, including in the promotion of justice, equality, health, and human rights. But controversies surrounding these aspirations also reveal the existence of divergent––often opposing––definitions of the body. This course asks how current political struggles over issues such as gender identity, racism, and reproductive and human rights involve conflicting understandings of the body. What relationships do these notions establish or depend upon between the body, identity, power, and truth? How do body politics inform debates about the anti-vaccination movement, “political correctness,” or body modifications? To denaturalize our ideas about the body, the course combines the exploration of current trends with the examination of views from diverse time periods and cultures. By identifying and analyzing these contrasting assumptions, the course seeks to better understand the challenges we face today, and how to address them. Major topics will include the problem of embodiment and the limits of our bodies; the role the body plays in the definition of racial and gender identities; bodily disciplines; and the human quest for truth.	0	0
299	299	CCOL-UH	1076	Foodways: Culture, Ethics, Sustainability	We’ve all heard the truism: “You are what you eat.” But are we also how we eat and how we procure what we eat? In an era of industrial food production and global climate change, we may need to ask what should we eat, in order to meet the challenges of food security and sustainable development. This colloquium asks what and how food can tell us about individual and community identities. It also asks how the ethics of individual food choice relates to the world's food systems. From the global Slow Food movement to novel approaches to food security and sovereignty here in the Gulf, what are the cultural politics of food? Is responsible eating a privilege or a human right? How do patterns in the production, distribution, and consumption of food promote such subjectivities as race, class, gender, and nation? How can asking what to eat serve as a vehicle for understanding the construction of such categories or contradictions in consumer behavior? How do scholars in various disciplines research local foodways in the context of the global food system? And what is food’s future in a world marked by increasing inequality, social injustice, and the devastating consequences of climate change?	0	0
300	300	CCOL-UH	1077	Food and Human Population	How do agricultural developments affect human population and demographic regimes? What constraints of traditional agriculture shape pre-industrial societies? Does human population, as the famous British political economist Thomas Malthus argued in 1798, increase faster than the means of subsistence, and if so, what are the implications? People need food and the production of food needs people (and land). The world’s population grew slowly, with major setbacks, from perhaps 200 million people in AD 1 to about 600 million in 1700 and to 2.3 billion on the eve of WW II. In just seventy years, it has soared to 7.7 billion, and the UN projects a total of 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 in 2100. How, then, has the per-capita intake of calories not declined worldwide and the balance of nutrients arguably improved? If past population growth was made possible by unprecedented agricultural expansion, will the future require a comparable increase? This colloquium offers broad economic and historical perspectives to approach practical dilemmas and ethical questions related to sustainability and global justice as students ask how best to feed the world’s current and future inhabitants.	0	0
301	301	CCOL-UH	1078	Who Owns Global Culture? Music, Networks, Law	Who owns global culture? Under what regimes of value and meaning does culture circulate across borders? How has cultural information been transcribed, recorded, stored, transported, transmitted, represented, and industrialized? What can this tell us about the logic of global cultural flow? How do specific techniques of archiving, annotating, and recording relate to global markets? Is unequal representation coded into global culture’s ubiquitous digitalization? This course tackles such questions, with a particular emphasis on music and sound in global circulation today. It asks how music and sound circulate within variable networks of meaning and value (institutional, vernacular, affective), with a particular interest in retrieving the often tributary and ephemeral phenomena found in geographically-remote cultures that, for complex reasons, are systematically written out of world history. Along with close reading of cultural items (songs, artworks, and information objects), the course weaves into its findings the logics of global finance and law, the uneven distribution of communicative media in an international frame, and the multi-faceted role of political economy.	0	0

303	303	CCOL-UH	1080	Learning Languages in a Global Society	What is the relationship between multilingualism and global society? Does learning new languages correlate with a disposition toward global citizenship? This interdisciplinary colloquium integrates theory with practice in looking at the effects of language-learning on education, society, and cultural identity. In addition to developing a basic understanding of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) concepts, students will consider multilingualism from perspectives including educational and social psychology, diplomacy, business, and public policy. Along the way additional questions arise: In what settings does multilingualism thrive? What makes a language easy or difficult to learn? Why do some people succeed at learning new languages while others don’t? Can plurilingual citizens boost the economy of their countries? Does language-learning require and/or promote cultural understanding? Are there drugs that can accelerate language learning? Guest experts will address different areas of language education, social behavior, and psycho/neurolinguistics. All students will experiment over the course of the semester with acquiring a new language using the Duolinguo application.	0	0
304	304	CCOL-UH	1081	Migration and Belonging	How does the ceaseless movement of people - a key feature of our globalized world - impact our sense of the self, of social identity, and indeed of political rights, all of which are anchored in a presumption of “belonging” that is secured by primordial ties of blood and soil. “Migrant,” “Refugee,” and “Indigenous” are among the most fraught terms in a time when the “Citizen” has been elevated to being the singular legitimacy. Formal citizenship often excludes migrants or those who were born to parents of foreign nationality. What are the tensions between citizenship and mobility? Can one recognize both the “right” to movement and mobility alongside assertions of the preeminence of “local populations”? How are these competing claims conceptualized and rights affirmed? What are the distinct valences of terms like “Neighbor,” “Stranger,” “Citizen,” “Alien,” “Guest,” and “Resident”? And how do we debate the contrasting conceptual grounds of territorial claims and circulatory flows? In this multidisciplinary colloquium, students will engage these in order to understand better the place of the nation-state and the experience of citizenship in the context of globalization.	0	0
305	305	CCOL-UH	1082	Multispecies Living and the Environmental Crisis	How do we understand and make sense of the consequences of what has clearly become a climate emergency? What conditions catalyzed this moment of crisis? Why and how might we consider re-orienting our habits of thought and action to engage this global challenge? What are the limits of anthropomorphism or the anthropomorphic imagination, of assigning human attributes to nonhuman others? Our notions of “development” and “progress,” our conception of natural resources, our relationship to the technocratic imagination have all contributed to the making of the Age of the Anthropocene, in which human agency reshapes our environment. This course will engage with a range of approaches that re-conceptualize the relationship of humans with nature. It will study the environmental consequences of urbanization, resource frontiers, extractive industries, the quest for sustainable energy, human-animal conflict, and the politics of conservation. It will conclude by asking what constitutes environmental justice as students explore the need to recalibrate multiple disciplines to generate a “multispecies” perspective on our world.	0	0
306	306	CDAD-UH	1001Q	Data	Data are everywhere. We have massive datasets keeping track of humanity’s everyday minutiae from babies born to calories consumed, friends made to crimes committed. How can we use these data to make useful predictions and gain insights into ourselves and humanity in general? This course introduces the basics of learning from data and covers topics such as wrangling, exploration, analysis, prediction, and storytelling through data visualization.	0	0
307	307	CDAD-UH	1002Q	Space	What’s out there? For centuries, curious astronomers peered up into the night sky and saw stars, planets, and the occasional comet. Nowadays, astronomers have a suite of tools at their disposal to observe objects in space and help to answer the fundamental questions about the intricate workings of the Universe. From arrays of radio dishes spanning continents to gamma-ray detectors on satellites orbiting the Earth, astronomy is now truly Multi-Wavelength. This course is a journey of discovery, where students peer at objects such as quasars, stellar nurseries, galaxy clusters, supernovae, black holes, extrasolar planets, neutron stars, molecular clouds and gamma-ray bursts through various telescopes. Research and presentation will form a core part of the course, and experimental and quantitative methods will be brought to bear on our understanding of other worlds. How these results can be communicated to the scientific community and the public will be discussed, along with the relevance to society, including spin-off technologies. Data & Discovery Core courses develop the ability to use experimental and quantitative methods to understand the world—and in this course—other worlds!	0	0
308	308	CDAD-UH	1004EJ	Microbes	Microbes are the most abundant organisms on Earth. They practically exist in every environment on our planet and play major roles in defining our atmospheric composition, sustaining the food webs that feed us and significantly influencing our health. Yet, microbes are diverse; they vary in size from 0.2 micrometers (1/300th diameter of a human hair) to a few millimeters. Some microbes are loners while others live in communities that talk to each other and coordinate behavior. The class will introduce students to microbes by examining their importance, ecology and diversity.  The class will take students on a journey of how early microbiologists classified microbes, isolated and cultured them and how today DNA sequencing has revolutionized the way scientists classify microbes. Throughout the course, students will isolate samples to image and culture microbes and isolate their DNA from around the NYU Abu Dhabi campus and the emirate of Abu Dhabi. DNA samples will be sequenced using portable DNA sequencing technology (MinION technology), which generates data rapidly. Students will finally use simple, streamlined computer language scripts to analyze sequencing data, classify microbes in their samples and present their findings to the rest of the class.	0	0
309	309	CDAD-UH	1005EJQ	Forensic Science	“Every contact leaves a trace.” This phrase, coined by the pioneer of forensic science Edmond Locard, is the starting point of all forensic investigations. Scientific measurements are used to discover traces left at the crime scene and connect them to a person, object, or place. But what is it about science that allows us to make these connections? And how are facts determined by scientific measurements different from those recorded during an interrogation? Does the word “fact” carry the same meaning in the legal system as it does to you or to an experienced scientist? In this course, students explore these questions while analyzing samples left at a crime scene using biological, chemical, and physical laboratory techniques used in forensics. Exploring the underlying scientific principles and analyzing adjudicated cases, they discuss the capabilities and limitations of forensics, how it relates to the criminal justice system, and its impact on society.	0	0
310	310	CDAD-UH	1006EJQ	Coastal Urbanization and Environmental Change	Over 80% of the Australian population lives within 100 km of a coast and virtually all major Australian cities occur on coastlines. As a result, Australia’s coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of Sydney, Australia’s largest city, as a case study to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas worldwide. Using Sydney’s terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a natural laboratory for field research, students collect environmental data throughout the city and use geographic information systems (GIS) to examine the spatial patterns of human impacts to Sydney’s environment and to compare their results with patterns observed in other coastal cities.	0	0
311	311	CDAD-UH	1007EQ	The Mind	This course explores definitions and theories of the mind and how it may work. Students will learn how philosophers, psychologists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists have studied the mind and will consider several demanding but stimulating questions about thought, memory, and behavior. Readings and discussions will review the historical and scientific developments that led to contemporary understandings of the mind and the challenges and answers that these views pose to our common-sense understanding of, for instance, the unconscious mind, the irrational mind, and the subjective nature of memories.	0	0
312	312	CDAD-UH	1008EQ	Seven Wonders of the Invisible World	“In the year of 1657 I discovered very small living creatures in rain water.” This quote is attributed to Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch merchant whose skillful use of glass lenses allowed him to peer into a world of microorganisms that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. His careful observations gave way to advances in microscopy that have allowed scientists to observe detailed structures of plants, viruses invading cells, intricate crystal lattices, and the seemingly chaotic motion of small particles. In this course, microscopy is explored, first by examining the fundamental optical systems used to magnify objects, and eventually by using sophisticated microscopes to make observations. We explore seven wonders of the invisible world - natural animate and inanimate phenomena that include micro-animals, plant and animal cells, bacteria and viruses, fungi, proteins, and naturally occurring crystals.	0	0
313	313	CDAD-UH	1009EJQ	Behavior	Why we behave in a particular way is one of the most fascinating and complex questions and one that we often cannot even explain to ourselves. What drives behavior? How can behavior be measured? And can behavior be changed? This course will examine behavior from the viewpoints of biology, neuroscience, psychology and economics. We will emphasize designing and interpreting experiments that measure behavior in both animals and humans. We will discuss topics as diverse as circadian rhythms, memory and anxiety and examine how being part of a group affects behavior. We will also measure animal and human behavior and learn how to analyze and present quantitative data.	0	0
314	314	CDAD-UH	1010EQ	Diversity	This course will investigate two fundamental concepts: Identity (“Who am I?”) and Diversity (“How am I different from other human beings?”). These questions will be addressed from cultural, environmental, and biological perspectives. We will examine the origin of human diversity, how human diversity is measured and analyzed, and how our perception of diversity has changed through history. Emphasis will be placed on recent progress in genetics and evolution and how this progress affects our daily life and identity. Students will learn how genes can inform us about human history, ancestry, and evolution. The laboratory component of the course will demonstrate how data are generated and analyzed, and will explore the difficulty encountered by scientists in inferring processes from observations and experiments. Students will have the option to collect and analyze genetic data from their own genome.	0	0
315	315	CDAD-UH	1011EQ	Observing the Universe	Observation is always the first step in the scientific process, usually followed by hypotheses and experimental tests. In astronomy, observation is nearly the only way to get data and test theories. For most of human history, astronomical observations were done using the human eye aided by simple instruments. The early telescopes were also aids to the human eye. It wasn’t until photography was invented in the late 19th century that astronomy began to become independent of an individual observer’s eyes. In this class, students will explore the historical development of our understanding of the Universe through observational tools and techniques. We will start with the instruments of the ancients and progress to the modern era using data from today’s most advanced observatories which are no longer limited to light our eyes can see. However, we are still limited almost exclusively to what the Universe chooses to show us through electromagnetic or other types of radiation, since even our deepest space probes have only barely left the solar system. This course will entail several observations at night.	0	0
316	316	CDAD-UH	1012	Randomness	Does randomness actually exist, or is it a human theoretical construction? How does our understanding of randomness condition our ability to make sense of the world? This course will explore the role of randomness in human experience and agency, probing how our understanding of chance affects how we produce meaning and knowledge. It starts by looking at how early cultures thought about and reacted to randomness and also considers later efforts to reify uncertainty with mathematics. Then, we will examine how scientists and artists manipulate chance in their work, and build on those efforts using interactive simulations and course projects.	0	0
317	317	CDAD-UH	1013EJ	Stem Cells: Immortality and Regeneration	Stem cell biology and gene-editing techniques are two technologies that when combined are transforming medical care. They are undoubtedly an integral component of future treatments. At the same time, these technologies raise novel ethical issues challenging the definition of what we consider human life at its core. Through lectures, practical examples, and discussions we will try to find answers to these questions and more: What are stem cells? How are they “made” in laboratories? Can they cure people? Are current stem cell technologies safe? Can we clone people to harvest organs? Can we generate animal-human chimeras to harvest organs and cells? What are the ethical concerns when using stem cells in combination with gene editing technologies? These questions are key to understand stem cell- and gene editing-based therapies, their practical applications, and their safety and ethical considerations. We will read and discuss the literature describing milestones in stem cell research and genome editing.  and gain practical training in growing and differentiating embryonic stem cells. We will also review the ethical and political issues regarding the use of stem cells.	0	0
318	318	CDAD-UH	1014EJ	Social Chameleons	Humans are deeply social animals, changing our thoughts and actions to fit in with others. In this course, students will learn about the reasons why we identify with groups, how groups shape our perceptions and behavior, and how we can influence the groups we belong to. This interdisciplinary course will examine the role of groups in human life, drawing insights from organizational behavior, political science, sociology, psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology. In addition to engaging with readings, demonstrations, and discussion, students will have the opportunity to get their hands dirty with real research, designing and conducting studies on group processes in the classroom and the field. These activities will go beyond the typical classroom experience and allow students to make connections to real world issues, such as conformity, diversity, and intergroup conflict.	0	0
319	319	CDAD-UH	1015J	Music and the Mind	Music is universal to all human cultures. It has profound and demonstrated effects on everything from emotion to spirituality to healing to the cohesion of communities. Music listening and discovery applications from Pandora to Spotify enable users to explore these attributes by analyzing and organizing large collections of music audio. This course will explore current research on the psychological, emotional, and therapeutic effects of music and what factors in the human body and brain are involved in producing them. Relevant research perspectives will include music theory and musicology; perception and cognition; neuroscience; and computational modeling. In particular, we will explore how commonalities and differences of musicianship across cultures could surface those aspects of musical understanding that are innate and which are culturally conditioned. Students will learn basic audio analysis and processing techniques to design and conduct experiments on the perception and cognition of music across cultures, leading to the automated production of playlists with specified qualities from their own or publicly available music collections.	0	0
320	320	CDAD-UH	1016EQ	Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments	Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world’s largest cities. As a result, the world’s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.	0	0
321	321	CDAD-UH	1017EQ	Symmetry	Symmetries are ubiquitous in nature and permeate the arts. Beginning with both intuitive definitions and more formal mathematical descriptions, the course will explore the symmetries in the subatomic constituents of matter and their interactions, larger-scale chemical and biological compounds, and the macroscopic natural world. Students will explore ways in which the human psyche is primed to find symmetry beautiful and examine the symmetries that underlie artistic creations, from geometrical patterns in artwork, to rhythm and chord progression in musical composition, and meter and rhyme in poetry. After a thorough study of symmetry, the course will end with a discussion of asymmetries and broken symmetries in nature and aesthetics.	0	0
322	322	CDAD-UH	1019Q	Heat and the Universe	The study of temperature and of heat, as formulated in the laws of thermodynamics, will be used as a unifying guide to examine a variety of phenomena in our natural world. In the physical world, course topics will encompass the cooling of the Universe in its early minutes as well as the dramatic expansion in the first seconds after the Big Bang and the role that temperature fluctuations have played in the Earth’s history. In the animal world, the course covers the surprising discovery of heat-loving bacteria and the techniques mammals, including humans, have adopted for temperature regulation. Readings will include materials from various scientific realms such as cosmology, biology, and geology.	0	0
323	323	CDAD-UH	1020JQ	Challenges in Global Health	Why are clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs still failing in so many places in the world? In this course we tackle this question as a lens through which to investigate challenges in global health. Together, we will explore the social, political, and biological bases of primary public health challenges in the WASH sector. Case studies will center on East Africa from the perspective of applied medical anthropology. Using data from an active WASH program in Nepal, students will work in teams on basic data manipulation, analysis, and visualization and will travel to Nepal, to witness WASH challenges first-hand, and to present findings to a group of project planners, NGO staff, and other stakeholders interested in project evaluation. These data-analysis skills and the perspective of social and cultural issues that impact global health provide the basis for categorizing the course as Data and Discovery and Structures of Thought and Society Core Course. It also counts as a regular elective under the SRPP curriculum, and as an Institutions and Public Policy elective (under the new SRPP curriculum). NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Nepal.	0	0
324	324	CDAD-UH	1021EJ	Neural Basis of the World’s Languages	What is the neural basis of our ability to speak and understand language? Answering this question is fundamental to understanding the human mind; data from pre-surgical brain mapping have been central to these efforts. A major challenge for presurgical language mapping, however, is the unavailability of the relevant tests in many of the world’s languages. Thus patients are often tested in a language other than their native one. This course explores the fundamentals of neurolinguistics and ways in which modern brain imaging technology has revolutionized our understanding of the human mind. In it students will translate presurgical language mapping tests into as many languages as possible (as determined by the students’ own language backgrounds) and will run tests on at least one healthy participant whose brain activity is recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Students will thus gain a hands-on experience collecting, analyzing, and presenting brain data at the Neuroscience of Language Lab at NYUAD. Knowledge of languages other than English, especially Arabic, is a plus.	0	0
325	325	CDAD-UH	1022JQ	Sustainable Development	Sustainable development is the most significant global challenge of our time. In fact, humanity’s survival depends on finding ways to maintain societal progress while living healthily within the carrying capacity of the Earth.  This course introduces students to the concepts, literature, sciences, methods, data, and practices of sustainable development both globally and locally. We start with history and global observations, and gradually work our way to regional and local issues involving people, industries, ecosystems, and governments. Topics include the use of energy, water, and other resources, emissions, climate change, and human and ecological health impacts. We review the economic implications of pathways to a sustainable future. In all our discussions, societal impacts such as equity and justice are considered, and discovery of data needs and analysis are explored.  After taking this course, students will understand the current state of sustainable development and become equipped with knowledge frameworks, methods, tools, and data analysis skills in order to ask as well as answer important questions in their professional careers and everyday life.	0	0
326	326	CDAD-UH	1024Q	Reading Like a Computer	How do computers “read” text, and how can computer-assisted analysis of texts give us new access to information about ourselves and the cultural legacies we have inherited? This course explores quantitative methods for discovering and analyzing diverse texts of the human record. It also offers a glimpse into possible futures of reading. Students will both discuss, and put into practice, forms of computer-assisted textual analysis that have revolutionized research in humanities and social science fields in recent years. They will also take a critical look at the “ubiquitous analytics” and the “ubiquitous virtuality” of everyday life. By engaging with the idea of data in the humanities, the course encourages students to reconsider our common-place assumptions about how reading works. Course materials, discussions, and classroom exercises will push students to examine how basic ideas about a text such as author, subject, setting, character or even style might look different when a non-human is involved in the interpretation. The course assumes no prior computer or coding skills, but a willingness to explore new technologies is essential for success.	0	0
327	327	CDAD-UH	1025Q	Numeracy	A lack of facility with words suggests illiteracy. A lack of facility with numbers suggests innumeracy. Daily life brings constant encounters with arguments made using words and numbers. This course examines the construction and use of numerical arguments. How are statistics constructed? How are they used to lie? How are they used to tell the truth? What relationships might exist between data, analysis, and societal inequities? The course concludes with the notion that just like words, numbers and statistics without a clearly specified structure may be dangerous when used to advance social, political, and economic arguments. How might numeracy better equip us to navigate such a world?	0	0
328	328	CDAD-UH	1026EJ	Water, Energy, Food Nexus	Billions of people on earth lack adequate access to water, food, and energy. What might be gained by recognizing the interdependencies that exist between these resources? It is well known that water is fundamental to agriculture and to the entire agro-food supply chain.  Moreover, it is clear that energy is required to produce and distribute water and food: to pump water, to power irrigation machinery, and to process and transport agricultural goods. But a global society requires industry and policymakers to take even broader views. For instance, how are water security, energy security, and food security linked, so that actions in one area will likely have impacts in one or both of the others? How will population growth, economic development, and climate change affect international efforts to eradicate poverty?  Additionally, what roles might renewable energy technologies play in providing access to cost effective, secure, and sustainable energy supplies? Students will approach these questions through multidisciplinary lenses and cultivate the skills required to address the social, economic, and environmental challenges posed by the water-energy-food nexus.	0	0
329	329	CDAD-UH	1027E	5000 Years of Notable Lives: Measuring Influence across Cultures	In the world of Big Data, information is everywhere; for example, Wikipedia biographies collect information for millions of individuals, translated into more than 200 languages for the most famous. The information is, however, not easily accessible for a quantitative analysis. The class will collect and analyze Wikipedia biographical information of one million biographies from 3000 BCE to now, with data scraping tools and text recognition techniques. It will extend the database (currently 1.9 million pages just in European languages) to terra incognita: based on students’ skills, editions in Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Russian, Polish, Dutch, Magyar, Turkish, Ukrainian, etc. will be added to the current stock of knowledge. Students will learn tools to scrape the internet and collect information (Python); to transform text into a proper database; to check and minimize errors; to analyze the reciprocal causation relations between the concentration of scientists, artists, politicians on the one hand, and the economic and political expansion of large cities on the other, using basic econometric techniques.	0	0
330	330	CDAD-UH	1030E	Better Living through Chemistry	“Better living through chemistry” is a riff on an advertising slogan that DuPont used from the 1930s to the early 1980s that has been used to promote the use of science to better our everyday lives and as a cynical criticism of the use of chemicals. Viewed either way, it unequivocally highlights the fact that chemistry plays an enormous role in life on earth, and knowledge of chemistry is essential for addressing many societal issues, such as climate change, clean water, air pollution, healthcare, food production and safety, recycling, energy generation and storage, and sustainability. This course explores the connections between chemistry and society, weaving the science together with major global societal issues and how data, evidence-based thinking, and the scientific method can be used to address the world’s most pressing problems.	0	0
331	331	CDAD-UH	1032	Stability	What makes a system stable or unstable? How does a lack of stability translate into chaos or turbulence? Every new device, experiment, or idea, requires a check for system stability. Important in science, engineering, politics, economics, and daily life, understanding stability enables predictability and control. In the late nineteenth century, philosophers, physicists, and mechanical engineers laid the foundations of hydrodynamic stability, the field which analyses the stability and onset of instability of fluid flows. How have these breakthroughs helped us to determine whether a given flow is stable or unstable, or to describe how possible instabilities can cause turbulence? And how might insights drawn from such fields offer insight into other areas of our lives, from monetary or political systems to bridges to interpersonal relationships?	0	0
332	332	CDAD-UH	1033EQ	Data and Human Space	Societies have traditionally used maps to represent, even construct, the spaces in which we live as well as the territories over which we assert control. But what has become of the map in the (post-)digital age? Has our relationship to human space changed in our data-rich world? Are we unknowingly map-makers by virtue of walking around with our devices? This course explores the specific role that technology can play in our understanding of both historical and contemporary map making. Through regional and global examples of urban culture mapping, the course’s focus on data discovery extends beyond working with official data to creating our own data within familiar environments. In addition to seminar discussion of readings and audiovisual materials, the course will host guest speakers. It also has a lab component with two main assignments. First, we focus on larger Arabian Gulf region through the eyes of historical cartographers and colonial geographers. Second, we will turn to the city of Abu Dhabi itself to see how (and why) we might map some of its spaces of human culture using simple technology. The course assumes no prior computer skills, but a willingness to explore new technologies is essential for success.	0	0
333	333	CDAD-UH	1034Q	Numbers, Models, and Chaos	The hallmark of a successful scientific theory is its ability to predict the outcome of experiments. Yet the last century’s most shocking scientific development is the mathematical theory of chaos, with the subsequent realization that predictability has intrinsic limits. Such limits may have no practical importance (as in many engineering problems). Sometimes they shape an entire branch of science (as in meteorology). This course provides a challenging, but accessible, way to understand predictability’s limits, while still appreciating the bedazzling richness of phenomena that only theories which face these limits can possibly describe. The course brings together, in a cohesive whole, ideas about numbers and infinities; the inner working of computing machines; nuances and concessions occurring in model-building; the meaning of randomness and of determinism. Students will participate in the construction of mathematical models (mostly inspired by population biology) under the form of iterated maps, and interact with simple computer simulations of those models to illustrate key concepts of nonlinear dynamics: stability, limit cycles, attractors, and predictability.	0	0
334	334	CDAD-UH	1035J	Human Prehistory: A Unified Approach	Recent advances in genetics have led to a new understanding of the history of our species, but the genetic data only make sense in the context of other fields of study.  Paleoanthropology, archaeology, linguistics and climatology all contribute to our understanding of how our species evolved and spread around the world.  This course will start at the beginning, with the very earliest evidence of our species in the fossil record in Africa and Asia.  We will quickly move into the great migrations that led to the settlement of the world over the past 100,000 years.  Finally, we will learn how studies of ancient DNA are leading to a revolutionary new understanding of events in the past 10,000 years, including the ethnogenesis of most modern human groups.	0	0
335	335	CDAD-UH	1036EJQ	Community-Driven Development	Community-Driven Development (CDD) aims to empower local communities to work together to identify and meet their own development needs. In contrast to top-down efforts that have long dominated the international development landscape, donors and governments are now investing heavily in CDD and placing much confidence in its ability to improve livelihoods, governance and social cohesion. Centered on a field study of Philippines, where the professor has been part of a five-year evaluation of a large-scale CDD initiative, this course examines (1) the theory and goals behind CDD, (2) the practice of CDD in Philippines and around the world, and (3) the data that help us determine if and how the approach works, or doesn’t. Alongside reading of academic and policy documents, students will participate in in-person and virtual visits with CDD donors and practitioners and visit with communities that have participated in CDD. By working with primary quantitative and qualitative data, students will have the first-hand opportunity to delve into a data discovery process and contribute to understanding and improving the practice of international development. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.  This course includes a required international trip to Philippines.	0	0
336	336	CDAD-UH	1037	Cyberwarfare	Einstein once said, “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” The answer to part one of his statement is here: World War III will likely be a cyber war. Election hacking, power grid cyberattacks, troll farms, fake news, ransomware, and other terms have entered our daily vocabularies and are here to stay. This course aims to introduce students to the cyberwarfare landscape: the actors, capabilities, techniques, impacts, legal and geopolitical issues, and defense systems it necessitates. How has the threat of cyber war transformed our definitions of privacy and security, on individual, national, and international planes? We will dive in with specific case studies, such as power grid cyberattacks, and we will perform cyber tabletop exercises. The first half of the course establishes the technical foundations needed for understanding cyberspace; the second half approaches the problem from different angles, attempting to understand the repercussions of technological, legislative, and political changes.	0	0
337	337	CDAD-UH	1038J	Evolution of Human Genomic Variation	Genetic and genomic data (and increasingly epigenetic and epigenomic data) are providing important insights into human evolutionary history. Human evolutionary genetics/genomics can illuminate how one human genome differs from another, the evolutionary past that gave rise to it, and its current effects, including its genomic, epigenetic, and phenotypic consequences. Differences between genomes have historical, physiological, anthropological, forensic, medical, and ethical implications and applications. This intensive mini-course emphasizes genetic and genomic diversity in peoples of African descent as an understudied but highly relevant segment of humanity. We will explore an array of topics from the perspectives of human biology and bioinformatics. Weekly laboratory and discussion-intensive sessions, local field trips, and video assessments are designed to provide students with hands-on exposures to diverse research environments. Students will have an opportunity to investigate their personal sequenced genomic data to test various hypotheses about genomic variation using tools of bioinformatics.	0	0
338	338	CDAD-UH	1039EQ	Search	How do we find what we’re looking for? How do we know when we’ve found it? If we can't tell the future, how do we make choices that impact the rest of our lives, such as finding a life partner, a fulfilling career, or even a good Core course? This course examines the nature and implications of such search processes. Questions addressed include why marital selection (when and whom to marry) has changed so much over time. Why do more women than men now go to college in some parts of the world? What does the data suggest explains these major societal changes?

339	339	CDAD-UH	1040	Artificial Intelligence and Human Decisions	How do we make decisions? How fully do we trust our capacity to weigh evidence and decide correctly, whether as individuals or as members of juries or other collective bodies? Does Artificial Intelligence promise objective decision-making or threaten to reproduce human biases? This course approaches such questions by examining artificial decision-making systems (ADMS), which are now used in a range of settings, from predicting consumer behavior or diagnosing diseases to managing self-driving cars. Students will explore the psychological and neural bases of decision-making as well as the ethics and social and political consequences of our turn to AI as an alternative. The most advanced ADMS employ complex machine-learning to deduce decision rules from vast data sets. They improve themselves by learning from their past decisions (correct or incorrect). However, the data sets used to train ADMS are human generated and hence may reproduce biases and problems. For a deeper understanding of the topic, students will consider the potential use of ADMS in the legal domain, where currently only human beings make decisions, but where changes might loom in the near future.	0	0
340	340	CDAD-UH	1041EQ	Decisions and the Brain	Where do errors come from? How can we make better decisions? Should intuition be trusted? Can we nudge others to make better decisions, and should we? This course examines neural bases for human decisions and cognitive biases. Drawing from economics, psychology, and neuroscience, it takes an interdisciplinary perspective on topics including decision-making under risk (how humans deal with probabilities), intertemporal decisions (saving for the future), and social decisions (interpersonal allocations and fairness). Students will explore different notions of rational behavior, how data on human behavior and brain activity is collected, and how we can use these data to improve decisions. Hands-on experience will include lab visits (both behavioral and brain imaging) and data collection through online platforms as students gain familiarity with different models of decision-making (including expected utility theory vs. prospect theory for decisions under risk, exponential vs. hyperbolic discounting for intertemporal decisions, and selfish vs. social preferences for interpersonal decisions) and examine how these models reflect available neural evidence.	0	0

384	384	CSTS-UH	1001	Quantum Theory and Relativity: The Impact of a Scientific Revolution	At the beginning of the 20th century, a scientific revolution started that was destined to change radically the way we think about the physical world. Einstein’s theory of relativity completely altered notions of time and space, laying the theoretical foundation for the use of nuclear power. At the same time, a new quantum theory was developed to describe the behavior of atoms and nuclei. It led to great technological advances, with much modern technology crucially exploiting quantum effects. But the revolutionary advent of relativity and quantum mechanics came with significant consequences: Physics became detached from the public’s everyday experiences and intuition. Challenging that notion of inaccessibility, this course analyzes some of the basic concepts of relativity and quantum theory.	0	0
385	385	CSTS-UH	1002J	State and Fate of Earth	What is the current state of the Earth in terms of human well-being and human impact on the Earth’s natural systems? Issues such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, climate change, food production, water, and material fluxes are intricately tied together as a global system. The economic trend of this system can be used to project a world in 2050 in which the world’s lifestyle will be approximately equal to that of many developed nations today. Will this projected state of the world be possible, given the environmental issues above? Investigating this topic in Sydney gives us perspective from a developed nation with unique climate, resources, and world-famous biodiversity. Substantial portions of this inquiry-based seminar require students to compare environmental issues in Australia to those in their home nations, other developed regions, and the world, in order to look at how conditions and solutions in Australia might be generally applicable to shared challenges.	0	0
386	386	CSTS-UH	1003Q	What Is a Number?	Numbers pervade our lives, so it may seem self-evident what they are. But like languages, technologies or ideologies, numbers have a history, and understanding of them has changed over time and also been surprisingly controversial. Zero was discovered and accepted as a number 1500 years ago; it was considered a dangerous idea in some civilizations. The existence of infinity was fiercely debated by philosophers as well as mathematicians. Understanding numbers requires insights from the liberal arts of the ancient quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) considered in their unity through their relationships with numbers. Pythagoras, Plato, Al-Kindi, Kepler, Turing, Mandelbrot and others have thought about concepts of measure, order, chaos, harmony, unity, diversity and universality. Reading these authors will help us understand why even today’s science has no definitive answer to the apparently simple question about its faithful servants: what is a number?	0	0
387	387	CSTS-UH	1004J	Science in Flux: The Galilean Revolution	How does science develop and change? What sorts of considerations are used to assess and evaluate scientific theories, particularly when those theories upend our entire picture of the physical world and our place in it? Are there factors that go beyond the empirical data itself, such as broader conceptual and religious considerations? And are these “extra-empirical” considerations legitimate constraints on scientific inquiry? This course will examine these big questions about the nature of science in the context of Galileo’s groundbreaking theory on the nature of motion - a theory that laid the groundwork for Newton and the rise of modern science. We will look at the many conflicts in which Galileo became embroiled - scientific, religious, and personal - and study the historical developments that eventually led to widespread acceptance of the Galilean worldview. Our aim will be to understand the complicated way in which Galileo’s physics emerged, was resisted, and eventually triumphed, and to situate that evolution within a broader narrative about the nature of scientific development and change.	0	0
388	388	CSTS-UH	1005Q	About Mathematics	Mathematics takes its problems from the real world and puts order into chaos. It sometimes strongly challenges common sense and produces extraordinary dreams of human history. The course concerns questions and concepts from various areas in mathematics, in particular number theory: the “alarm clock numbers” and some of their applications (for example to music); irrational numbers and their intimate links with art and geometry as well as the scandal raised by their discovery in ancient Greece; the Golden Ratio with its surprising mathematical properties, its connections with biology through Fibonacci sequences and art history; prime numbers and their chaos, order and mystery; the fantastic number π, some of its properties, and messy and beautiful formulae to approach it; continued fractions, the sum of two-squares theorem; the five (or three) Platonic solids from prehistory to modern times; some amazing paradoxes raised by probabilities; and Poincaré’s finite-infinite universe. Through these and other examples we will consider how and why mathematics is a subversive intellectual activity, relying on passion, imagination, and beauty as much as on logic and rigorous argumentation.	0	0
389	389	CSTS-UH	1006	Thinking	Thinking is what we do when we solve problems, compare alternatives, and plan for the future. But what is thinking, and how do thoughts form? People throughout history have come to very different answers to this question and have offered different metaphors for thought. The French Philosopher Descartes drew inspiration for his theories of the mind from mechanisms that were powered by pneumatics. Our modern understanding of thinking is shaped by the computer revolution. The class will discuss the underpinnings of the main fields of Psychology (e.g. Behaviorism, Freudian, Cognitive), as well as to how thinking has been viewed in a broader historical and multicultural context. We will explore how thoughts on thinking have shaped our understanding of who we are and how our metaphors of thought have been inspired by technological developments and shaped by culture.	0	0
390	390	CSTS-UH	1007Q	Chance	Chance is a common word whose meaning can vary, but which generally applies to situations involving a certain amount of unpredictability. We all spend a lot of time and effort to evaluate and possibly increase our chances of success, or to minimize certain risks. If philosophical discussions about chance and randomness can be traced back to antiquity, probabilistic and statistical concepts appeared more recently in mathematics. The ambition of the theory of chance has been to deal rationally with this elusive notion. Starting with gambling strategies, the theory now applies to the core of almost all scientific and technical fields, including statistical and quantum mechanics, chaotic dynamics, phylogenetics, sociology, economics, risk management, and quality control. We will provide a broad introduction, organized as a journey in the history of ideas. We will investigate key concepts (including independence, expectation, confidence intervals, or tests), consider their applications to specific fields of science, and illustrate them by computer experiments.  Readings include excerpts from Lucretius, Pascal, Hume, Laplace, Peirce, and Hacking.	0	0
391	391	CSTS-UH	1008	Birth of Science	When was science invented or discovered? And is this issue still relevant to our interpretation and use of the scientific method? Because of the great wealth of scientific results obtained in the Hellenistic period of ancient Greece, the course will take up such questions starting from that period. We will analyze the works of Euclid and Archimedes and others in Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, and Geography, with a particular focus on very modern, and maybe still undiscovered, contents. The achievements of Hellenistic science and the issues it raised will be compared with some of those appearing in other golden ages of science, such as ancient Babylonia, the Islamic Golden Age, the Renaissance, and our times. The course will not consist of a review of established facts, but rather the exploration of sometimes controversial interpretations.	0	0
392	392	CSTS-UH	1009	Theory of Everything	This course provides a global viewpoint on the most theoretical foundations of science, within and across theoretical physics and mathematics. It addresses the concept of the infinite in math but also the (sought after) theory of grand unification in physics. While these subjects are quite daunting, the course will pursue a conceptual approach that is accessible to students. Topics and questions will include: First, what does infinity really mean? This seemingly simple question is one of the deepest in math. The current answers solve many problems but also lead to non-intuitive consequences. Second, is there a unifying theme in mathematics or a set of principles underlying all its branches? If so, would this set be complete? Consistent? Third, seeking a theory of everything in physics would unify all the forces of nature (electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear forces, and gravity) via combining quantum theory and general relativity. Is this a reasonable or attainable quest? What would its consequences be? Fourth, are the above quests related? Are unifying themes in one aspect of nature (e.g. physics) expected to reflect similar themes in another (e.g. math)?	0	0
393	393	CSTS-UH	1010	Astronomy & Cosmology: From Big Bang to Multiverse	For thousands of years humans have studied the skies to help them grow crops, navigate the seas, and earn favor from their gods. We still look to the stars today to answer fundamental questions: How did the Universe begin? Will the Universe end, and if so, how? And what is our place in the Universe? Astronomy and Cosmology help us answer these questions. We have learned that our place in the Universe is not special: the Earth is not at the center of the Universe; the Sun is an ordinary star; and the Milky Way is an ordinary galaxy. Astronomers have even suggested that the Universe itself may not be unique. This course aims to understand the Universe from the Big Bang to its future.	0	0
394	394	CSTS-UH	1012	Wealth of Nations	This course examines the determinants of economic development in the modern world. The course is divided into two parts. The first reviews theories that place factors of production such as labor and technology as the main cause of cross-country differences in economic wealth. The second part of the course investigates the role of institutions, culture, religion, geography, and luck as deeper causes of comparative development. The main questions addressed throughout the course are: Why are there such large differences in income per capita across countries? Why have some countries developed steadily over the past 200 years while many others have not? Why do some governments adopt policies that promote economic development while others set up barriers to economic activity? These questions are analyzed from a theoretical and empirical perspective.	0	0

397	397	CSTS-UH	1013J	Relationship of Government and Religion	This course examines the relationship between government and religion in the United States. We concentrate on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: “Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Using the opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court, the highest Court in the nation and final authority on constitutional interpretation, we explore how these words broadly prohibit the government’s entanglement with religion while also bestowing the responsibility to protect religious freedom. Prior knowledge is not required. Students must, however, participate in an orientation session, four introductory classes with Professor Sexton, and four recitations during the Fall II term in Abu Dhabi prior to the J-term meetings in NYC and Washington, D.C.  Through this course, students learn the foundation of a liberal arts education: reading complex texts, deconstructing sophisticated arguments, constructing their own reasoned opinions, and valuing differences in opinion. Further, students examine frameworks for thinking, social organization, and behavior.  This course is available only to NYUAD students studying in Abu Dhabi during the fall semester.	0	0
398	398	CSTS-UH	1014	Gender and Globalization	What does gender as a category of analysis indicate? How does gender intersect with other axes of identity such as class, nation, and ethnicity in a globalized world? The course introduces students to select women’s issues (e.g. employment, political participation, reproductive rights and healthcare, feminism vs. multiculturalism, gender-based violence, and peace building) that have emerged in the global context and the international debates that surround them. In addition, the course looks at the relevance of women’s representation to address barriers to gender equality in the “democratic process” as well as the shortcomings of democratic mechanisms to achieve women’s rights and some proposed solutions to these limitations.	0	0
399	399	CSTS-UH	1015	Legitimacy	What are the foundations of political legitimacy and to what extent do governments abide by them? This course will explore these questions using both classical and contemporary accounts. The first half will focus on political systems in Ancient Greece, Rome, Medieval Europe, and Early Modern Europe through the lens of great thinkers, including Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Burke, Weber, and Marx, as well as a series of primary source documents. We then proceed to the “post-1789” world and discuss legitimacy in the context of democratic government. Topics covered include the role of legislators, issue representation, descriptive vs. substantive governance, and the ongoing debate between advocates of majoritarianism and those of proportionalism.	0	0
400	400	CSTS-UH	1016	Ideas of the Sacred	The question of God(s) pertains to the existence, manifestations, meaning, and attributes of the sacred.  Although conceptions about the sacred are inevitably shaped by history and culture, the fundamental question of God(s) has had an enduring presence throughout human experience.  This course takes up this perennial human question from the context of some of the world’s major religious traditions including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism.  What similarities do these great traditions share, and how does their understanding of the sacred differ?  Additionally, the course explores the relation between reason and faith.  How does the empirical verification characteristic of an increasingly pervasive scientific and technological worldview impact on belief in God(s)?  Readings for the course are drawn from a variety of disciplines with a focus on primary sources and seminal works.	0	0
401	401	CSTS-UH	1017	Revolutions and Social Change	Why do revolutions occur in some places and times but not others? Why are some revolutions successful in taking state power, and why do most of them fail? When are successful revolutions able to dramatically transform the politics, economy and culture of a society? With these general questions in mind, we explore the history of different types of revolutions throughout the world. Drawing on several disciplines, using academic essays, films, novels, and poems to explore both the causes and the consequences of revolutions (the forcible overthrow and replacement of a government by the governed) from their inception in the 17th century until today. After discussing general theories of revolutions, the course turns to the early modern democratic revolutions in England (1688) and France (1789), then turn to the Marxist-inspired revolutions in Russia (1917) and China (1949), anti-colonial revolutions in the United States (1776), Latin America (19th century), and Africa (mostly post-WWII), and conclude with the revolutions in Iran (1979) and North Africa and the Middle East known as “Arab Spring” (early 2010s).	0	0
402	402	CSTS-UH	1018	Corruption	Political corruption exists everywhere, but which countries are most corrupt? Do highly corrupt countries have common characteristics? How much corruption is there? The social costs of political corruption, from stealing public funds to paying bribes to avoid basic safety and health regulations, are often extremely high. Why are most attempts to fight corruption unsuccessful? The course is comparative and historical, and as far as possible requires no background knowledge.	0	0
403	403	CSTS-UH	1019J	Aristocrats	When modern democracies were established, the aristocracies they replaced faced varying fortunes. Some were wiped out. Others lost political power but retained social status and economic power. Some maintained political power through institutions set aside for them. And others remained a ruling class, reinvented through democracy. This course draws on history, political science, anthropology, and literature to raise the following questions: How did the aristocracy’s fate vary when democracy was established? And how do these varying fortunes affect democratic politics? The course’s first half, in Abu Dhabi, will focus on conceptual and theoretical questions, comparing the UK, Zambia, Japan, the US, South Asia, and the Middle East. The course’s second half will include a field trip to India, where the aristocracy suffered a significant political decline, but was not wiped out, and has recently been reinventing itself. We will spend a week with members of the old aristocracy, including those who are politically successful now and those who failed, and visit their constituencies to understand what their success and failure means for democratic representation.	0	0
404	404	CSTS-UH	1020J	Surveillance and Privacy	This course examines the historical, sociological, cultural, and political significance of surveillance, with a particular focus on the relationship between surveillance and privacy. Drawing on a wide range of sources (including academic research, historical documents, literature, film, and social media), the course explores how developments in the practice and technologies of surveillance have shaped the ways in which we think about privacy, identity, and personal information over the last 3000 years. From the earliest use of spies and informers to contemporary techniques of identification and mass surveillance (such as census-taking, passports, and identify cards), students will explore key questions such as: (1) What is the relationship between surveillance and governance? (2) How has electronic surveillance changed the ways in which we think about individual identity and privacy?  (3) Can we balance a concern for individual freedom with the pursuit of security? The course will also focus on key historical debates about the appropriate limits of surveillance, including uses of information gathered from online behavior and social media.	0	0
405	405	CSTS-UH	1021EQ	Boundaries	How are boundaries created and what are their roles in society? This class will explore human, natural, and political boundaries as processes accompanying genetic, linguistic, religious, and cultural divergence. It will also investigate changing boundaries over time in various regions to see how these changes explain both socioeconomic and political outcomes today. Students will be exposed to various interdisciplinary literature and will learn to create their own digital maps using both archival and contemporary resources. They will also work with these novel data to present their own research ideas.	0	0
406	406	CSTS-UH	1022	Internationalism	Internationalism is a way of looking at the world that seeks both to describe and prescribe the degree and nature of interconnectedness among states and peoples. Since the 18th century, a variety of thinkers have used the language of internationalism to promote different visions about the development of trade, governance, and culture across borders. This course will analyze how these diverse intellectual traditions have contributed to internationalist thinking.  Five major questions will structure the discussion: 1. What is the relationship of internationalism to national and imperial imaginations? 2. Should internationalism be utopian, revolutionary, or reformist? 3. How should equality and justice inform the construction of a multilateral world? 4. What is the place of gender, race, and religion in the development of communities beyond nation-states? 5. Can internationalist projects accommodate differences in cultures, affects, and aesthetics? Readings will include texts by Immanuel Kant, José Martí, W.E.B. DuBois, Okakura Kakuzo, Woodrow Wilson, Rabindranath Tagore, George Orwell, Kwame Nkrumah, Nancy Fraser, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.	0	0
407	407	CSTS-UH	1023J	Democracy and Its Critics	This course examines the institutional structures and intellectual justifications of democratic societies. Although democracy and equality have been deeply linked in the history of political thought, critics of democratic practice argue that formal equality among citizens has rarely prevented substantive economic and political inequalities from arising - inequalities that seem to call into question the very democratic character of self-described democratic states. We begin by examining one of history’s most radical and influential democracies, ancient Athens. After reading Thucydides’ complex account of democratic Athens at war, we will turn to ancient debates about democracy found in such authors as Aristophanes, Isocrates, Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle. We then will compare these arguments to subsequent ones by Madison, Mill, Marx, Rawls, Dworkin, Przeworski, and Sen. The course concludes with a final week in Greece where we will recreate the intellectual dynamics of direct democracy in Athens using the Reacting to the Past game.	0	0
408	408	CSTS-UH	1024J	Sovereignty	From Ancient Mesopotamia to modern times, the idea of sovereignty - beginning with kingly power and leading to modern popular democracy and law-based forms of rule - has dominated political theory as well as theater, literature, and philosophy. The central questions of this course concern political power: hegemony, dominion, rulership, but also democracy, law, and economics. How do we think about power and its history? What does it mean for kings, the people, or particular parties to be called “sovereign”? How is this sovereignty to be depicted? Through a series of literary, philosophical, and political readings in the Western, Islamic, and Chinese traditions, we will examine these questions, against the extraordinary backdrop of Berlin and its history as capital of the German Empire and of the Third Reich, then as divided city, and finally now as perhaps the most important political center in Europe. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.	0	0
409	409	CSTS-UH	1025J	The Ghetto	On March 29, 1516, the city council of Venice forced Jews to live in a closed quarter, “il geto,” named for the copper foundry that once occupied the area. In this course, we trace the ghetto from these beginnings to its revival by the Nazis to the contemporary U.S. For if we are to understand today’s black ghettos, including the recent events in Ferguson, Missouri, it is useful to understand the Jewish ghettos of the past. We’ll study a little-known moment in the ghetto’s history: when thousands of Jews escaped to the only place that was open to them—Shanghai - and were ultimately herded into the Hongkew ghetto. We’ll ask how it is that the ills and cruelties of forced segregation do not crush the spirit of a people? How can we explain the fact that from Venice to Krakow to Harlem, ghettoized people have often flourished before getting blotted out by larger forces? How can we take account of the evil effects of ghettoization without losing sight of its benefits?	0	0
410	410	CSTS-UH	1026J	Children and Childhood: Medical, Historical, and Cultural Perspectives	How are children and childhood viewed in different cultures and centuries? To whom do children really belong—the parents, the state, the world? Whose responsibility is it to educate, feed, and care for children? Is a child a “blank slate” or a prepackaged set of emotions, intellectual abilities, and behaviors? This course emphasizes historical, medical, and cultural perspectives on childhood, exploring common themes and cultural variations, as reflected in literary texts and artistic representations in America, Europe, and China: Confucian analects, Song dynasty poetry, Ming ceramics, Italian European Renaissance painting, Persian and Mughal miniatures, Montaigne’s essays, John Locke’s philosophy, Rousseau’s educational ideals, English Romantic poetry, German Romantic Lieder, Freud on the dynamics of childhood, parenting advice from Dr. Spock and children's literature from Dr. Seuss.	0	0
411	411	CSTS-UH	1029J	Idea of the University	What makes a university? What is it for? Who is it for? Above all, who gets to decide? What are a university's necessary components and what its desirable accoutrements? How does the university’s avowedly pure pursuit of knowledge relate to the professions it simultaneously serves and helps to define, the societies which it builds and by which it is sustained? What distinguishes the university from other institutions of higher learning and research? Is the university’s idea universally translatable, or may the university be transformed as it goes global? This course takes a longitudinal survey of the debates and controversies surrounding the university and its place in society. It will canvas ancient Athens and Alexandria; medieval Islamic colleges and European cathedral schools; Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and student and faculty life at early universities; early modern scientific societies and confessional universities; nationalist and cosmopolitan agendas in the modern era. Students will furthermore examine how the university compares with classical Indian and Chinese educational schemes. The course concludes with a critical look at competing visions for the 21st-century university.	0	0
412	412	CSTS-UH	1030J	Global Perspectives on Inequality	This course seeks to address a central question: although societies drastically differ from one another, why is inequality such a common and persistent characteristic? We will approach this question from both theoretical and empirical perspectives to better understand inequalities by gender, race/ethnicity, immigration/migration status, nationality, sexuality, and the intersection of these lenses. A particular focus will be placed on Shanghai and the urban-rural and migration divides that organize much of Chinese society. Students will learn to critically analyze different forms of inequality and inequities. Readings from this course will cover ideas such as those proposed in early texts by Karl Marx and more contemporary arguments made by Black feminists such as Patricia Hill Collins. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.	0	0
413	413	CSTS-UH	1031	Why Is It So Hard to Do Good?	Why is it so difficult to eliminate some of the greatest causes of human suffering - war, state-failure, poverty, and tyranny? This course examines moral and practical controversies over how we ought to respond to these problems. We will focus in particular on whether, and if so how, the international community is justified in intervening in poor and violent parts of the world. By the end of the course students will be better at analyzing and discerning the plausibility of policy proposals and ideas.	0	0
414	414	CSTS-UH	1032J	City in Crisis: Refuge and Resilience	By 2030, 60 percent of the world’s population will live in cities. This mass urbanization presents unprecedented challenges for planners, policy makers, businesses, educators, citizens, migrants/refugees, and the environment. This course explores the multifaceted challenges the world’s cities face. It asks how crisis and revitalization complement each other, especially in light of current population movements fueled by climate change and wars. A week-long trip to Athens offers a case study of a vibrant historical capital faced with unprecedented economic crisis, high unemployment, and large number of refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and places far beyond. Readings from social science, social history, public policy, and literature, along with select films, will help students explore possibilities for refuge and resilience in this urban crisis. While visiting refugee camps, the Municipality of Athens, etc., students will assume different social roles and be paired with local business leaders, urban planners, policy makers, and members of refugee and migrant communities in order to deepen their practical experience of these complex issues.	0	0
415	415	CSTS-UH	1033J	Culture and Context in Psychology	The aim of this class is to explore and analyze classic theories of culture and context in the field of psychology, with a specific emphasis on understanding how these processes shape human development. We will also examine research that explores cultural and contextual variability among youth and families from different parts of the world. To explore these topics, we will be traveling to Ethiopia for four days of the class. Students will interview and be interviewed by students from the Ethiopian Foundation program in Addis Ababa. PLEASE NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Ethiopia.	0	0
416	416	CSTS-UH	1034	Idea of the Cell	Proteins and organic compounds came together over three billion years ago to form the first cell. However, we have only been able to see cells for approximately 300 years through the microscope. In the early days of cellular imaging, the cell body was figuratively represented as buzzing cities or mythological realms. Today, the power of electron microscopy and animation reveal more details about the inner life of cells than ever before, and yet subjective and singular interpretations of the cell have persisted. This course explores cellular identity in the context of visual imagery and advances in visualization. Students express their own ideas of the cell by creating original short films.	0	0
417	417	CSTS-UH	1035	Trust, Risk and Deception in Cyberspace	Cyberspace plays an increasing role in our lives as society rapidly becomes structured around the 24/7 availability and trustworthiness of information. We already entrust cyberspace with our privacy, national security, physical safety, and digital identities. Maintaining an orderly, peaceful, safe, and productive society will increasingly depend on maintaining trust in information systems. However, trust cannot be realized by technology alone. This course adopts the viewpoint that cyberspace is a social system that relies on important technical components. The course begins with a discussion of trust, risk, and deception as developed in the social sciences and examines how traditional notions apply or fail to apply to interactions in cyberspace. The second part of the course examines the technical underpinning of cyberspace and the mechanisms developed to create trustworthy systems. The third and final part of the course examines the interplay between the technical and social aspects to see how better policy and systems can be developed to tackle cybercrime, cyberespionage, cyberwar, and cyberterrorism. No previous computer science or engineering knowledge required.	0	0
418	418	CSTS-UH	1036	Progress in Science	Science is a social enterprise, although one traditionally thought to be grounded in facts and reason. Scientists collaborate with each other, undermine one another, and compete for funding of research. Whether a scientific idea ever sees the light of day may depend on these distinctly social factors. So how much of what we call “scientific progress” is the result of social negotiation, and how much is rational deliberation? That is the big question this course investigates - the question of the competing roles of rationality and rhetoric in the development of science. Do theoretical pictures change on account of reasoned argument, or rhetorical persuasion? The course examines this question through the lens of several important scientific revolutions, particularly the quantum one. The starting point will be Thomas Kuhn’s influential account of scientific progress. Does his picture really fit the historical facts? Several competing models of scientific progress will also be discussed. Along the way, students will consider why many scientific revolutions occurred in Europe and not elsewhere. Are some cultural and social features more hospitable than others to scientific inquiry?	0	0
419	419	CSTS-UH	1037	Gift and Exchange	Gift giving occurs in all cultures. A gift can be a material object or money, but it can also be an act of kindness or love. A gift is free but it can also come with the expectation that it will be matched by a return gift. Gift giving is therefore part of a complex structure of economic and social exchange. This course considers gift giving from the perspectives of anthropology, history, and the arts; it explores gift exchange through ethnographies as well as texts on market economies and art, gender, death, altruism, risk, and the impacts of colonialism on traditional exchange societies. Readings will include seminal works on gift exchange by Marcel Mauss, Bronislaw Malinowski, Franz Boas, and others.	0	0
420	420	CSTS-UH	1038	Peace	This course traces the development of philosophical, religious, and secular theories of peace from antiquity to the present. It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a “just war,” as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how these spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J. Muste, Johan Galtung, Alma Myrdal, and Petra Kelly, among others.	0	0
421	421	CSTS-UH	1039	Property	The institution of property describes one of the fundamental relationships between people and things. This seminar explores how understandings of property have been influenced by cultural and ethical norms in different civilizations; how property rights have evolved with technological progress and changes in the demands of the environment; how property is affected by and influences the sphere of individual freedom, the relation between the individual and the state, and the organization of productive activity. As examples, students will look at property in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome; consider the views on property expressed in Christianity and Islam; and discuss the role that changing views on property played in the Declaration of Independence, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution. Insights from these discussions will inform debates about contemporary issues in property rights, including intellectual property, rights to genetic material, inheritance, airwaves, financial regulation, the rights of indigenous peoples, claims on the Arctic, or the trade-off between rights to privacy and freedom of the press.	0	0
422	422	CSTS-UH	1040	Slavery and Freedom in Comparative Perspective	This course examines slavery in historical and comparative perspective by focusing on Greek and Roman slavery, African and Islamic slavery, and slavery in the American South, Brazil, and the Caribbean. We examine the difference between societies in which slavery existed and those which can be thought of as “slave societies,” asking how enslavement occurred, who was enslaved, and in what ways did they differ from non-slaves. What “rights” or standing in the law if any did slaves possess? What was the nature and extent of the master’s power over slaves? What were the social, economic, and political functions of slavery? But the study of slavery also inevitably involves broader, more fundamental issues concerning freedom, personhood, social inclusion, and belonging. As Orlando Patterson put it in Slavery and Social Death, “the idea of freedom and the concept of property were both intimately bound up with the rise of slavery, their very antithesis. Once we understand the dynamics of slavery, we immediately realize why there is nothing in the least anomalous about the fact that an Aristotle or a Jefferson owned slaves.”	0	0
423	423	CSTS-UH	1041	Ideology	What is an ideology? How do a series of sometimes disparate beliefs about issues come together to form an ideology? How do ideologies change and reform over time? This course explores these fundamental questions about beliefs in societies across the globe. It begins by defining ideologies and looking at examples from key intellectual movements of the last millennium (e.g., crusaderism/jihadism, liberalism, communism, fascism, religious nationalism, ethnic nationalism). In this intellectual journey, students read some of the great thinkers who have shaped the concept of ideology over time, including Robespierre, Burke, Jefferson, Marx, Lenin, Mosca, and Benedict Anderson. Next the course asks how to measure ideologies. Students are introduced to quantitative tools for assessing ideologies from both individual-level surveys, voting behavior, and text (e.g., speeches and Twitter). The last part of the course examines how shifting ideologies beliefs have (or might have) consequences for a wide range of human phenomena, ranging from interpersonal interactions to elections and international conflict.	0	0
424	424	CSTS-UH	1042	Consumption and Material Culture	(Formerly CORES-AD 44)What are the social, political, and economic forces that bring consumer goods into being, keep them there, and then cause them to disappear from household use and enter the world’s waste stream? Searching for what anthropologist Mary Douglas called “an anthropology of consumption,” the course will look across history and places, to pre-modern Japan, Renaissance England, the contemporary UAE and North America. It asks about the politics of things and their shifting roles in everyday life. What is the nature of taste? of shopping? How do shifts occur depending on object, place, and time? Students will explore the logistics of fashion, the link between goods and geography, production systems, and distribution through retail markets. They will stretch theoretically across the political economy of Marx, neo-classical economics, and the more recent cultural-social schemas of Bruno Latour and Howard Becker. For a final project students will focus on a specific object that they research and present to class, based on readings, discussions and original research.	0	0
425	425	CSTS-UH	1043	Great Divergence	In 1500 the economic, social, and political differences between Europe and Asia were small. By the twentieth century, the gaps were enormous. How can we explain this Great Divergence between Europe and Asia? The course will discuss the classical answers to this question given by Weber, Smith, Marx, and Malthus. Has modern research confirmed or contradicted their views? The roles of demography, politics, law, globalization, social structure, science, and technology will be discussed as well as the interconnections between them. The course aims to expose the methods that social scientists and historians use to answer grand questions of social evolution, so that the approaches can be compared, contrasted, and assessed.	0	0
426	426	CSTS-UH	1047	The Body	The body seems to be an essential part of our sense of individuality. Nevertheless, our bodies and the ways we perceive them are also the result of social and collective forces. This course will study how the body has been perceived and experienced across different cultures and societies. It will explore multiple artistic, scientific, and literary representations of the body, as well as the body’s social, institutional, and political dimensions. It will seek to understand the role played by the body in the definition of the boundaries between human and non-human, in power relations and political regimes, and in the human quest for knowledge.	0	0
427	427	CSTS-UH	1048	Money	The need to trade goods and services within and across time is a requirement for the basic functioning of any society. When barter systems do not satisfy needs, the ability to engage in such trades requires a peculiar sort of good, namely, money. The course begins with the theory of money and asks why one uses either barter, commodity, or fiat monies, and the functions money serves. It then traces the history of the development of money and credit across societies to the present day and explores the centrality of money to various cultures and its representation in the arts. Students will discuss governmental manipulation of aggregate monetary stocks to spur or dampen trade or to finance conflict by debasing the value represented by this peculiar good. Such questions explore a central truth, that while modern money is intrinsically meaningless, its role in facilitating economic growth in the supply of real goods and services is surprisingly robust, provided policy does not deliver problems when too much money and credit is in circulation.	0	0
428	428	CSTS-UH	1049	Concepts and Categories: How We Structure the World	Humans have a strong tendency to group and divide objects, people, emotions, and events into different concepts and categories. These seemingly effortless acts pose fundamental questions about our understanding of the self and the nature of the world. This course examines texts from history, literature, philosophy, and scientific sources to ask why we conceptualize the world in particular ways, whether any categories are fundamental, and the degree to which concepts and categories are innate or learned. From the conceptual taxonomies proposed as fundamental from thinkers such as Aristotle and Kant, to the findings from psychology and neuroscience that inform us about our predilections for object concepts and social groups, students will reflect on what this knowledge can tell us about the forces that shape self and society.	0	0
429	429	CSTS-UH	1050Q	Uncertainty in Science	Science explores the unknown, and a major part of being a scientist is learning how to handle uncertainty. Statistical uncertainty, systematic uncertainty, the range of validity of models, approximations, data outliers, competing interpretations: scientists spend most of their time wrestling with these problems. Unfortunately, in popular culture, science is often presented as a series of proven facts. Uncertainty, if acknowledged, is portrayed as an argument between experts with opposing views. While science has resulted in some well-established facts, more commonly scientists have varying degrees of confidence in models and disagree about their significance. This class takes up the language of probability and statistics, explores how it became central to the scientific process, and examines how it is used by different scientific disciplines. Students will also explore how scientific uncertainty is often misrepresented to support particular political agendas or personal beliefs. Finally, they will discuss the limits of scientific knowledge, and how even when exact solutions to problems are not theoretically possible, humans can still put limits on our uncertainty.	0	0
430	430	CSTS-UH	1052X	History and the Environment: The Middle East	What is “the environment” and how can we conceptualize its history? Many historians are concerned with questions of voice, agency and power. How do we deal with these questions when writing about non-human actors like donkeys, cotton and coral reefs? Does focusing on the roles of non-human actors obscure other human dynamics like class, race, gender and sexuality? Further, the scholarly consensus on climate change and the varied responses to that consensus have motivated historians to contribute to the public discussion more actively. What is the relationship between understandings of environmental history and environmental activism? We will address these and other questions using the Middle East region as a case study, paying particular attention to how historians have approached these challenges in conversation with ecologists and other natural scientists. Students will also have the opportunity to write short environmental histories based on field trips, interviews, and sojourns into the digital humanities in the final part of the course.	0	0
431	431	CSTS-UH	1053	Understanding Urbanization	Why do humans continue to build and flock to cities? What makes a city work? How do we measure qualities of urban life? This course sheds light on the complex process of urbanization. It begins with debates about the different recent trajectories of urbanization in light of economic and political dynamics. Why have some trajectories been more successful than others? What factors have shaped a certain trajectory? What lessons we can learn from them? The focus will then shift to a myriad of contemporary cases from around the globe. The aim is to deconstruct common conceptions of dualities: development/underdevelopment, wealth/poverty, formality/informality, and centrality/marginality. The course material is structured around themes that highlight the main challenges that urban dwellers and policy makers face in the following areas: the economy, income inequality, marginalization, service provision, housing, infrastructure, immigration, safety, and the environment. These themes will allow students to engage with various forms of contestations and to consider the role of urban social movements.	0	0
432	432	CSTS-UH	1054J	Green Mobility and Cities	Transportation systems connect people, goods, places, and ideas. They both shape and respond to urban growth. Moreover, their environmental footprints are immense and expanding. Most contemporary problems facing cities and regions – congestion, pollution, energy dependence, climate change, social equality, employment opportunities, and even the obesity epidemic – are in some way tied to how we design, operate, manage, and price urban transportation systems. This course probes the potential role of green mobility and urban planning in advancing sustainable transportation futures across a range of global contexts.  What transportation investments, technologies, operational enhancements, urban designs, institutional reforms, and pricing regimes offer the most promise in bringing about sustainable urban growth and mobility in coming decades?  How might urban planning combine with emerging technologies to promote green mobility and sustainable, resilient cities?  Drawing from international experiences and best practices, this course challenges students to draw upon social-science knowledge to take on these and similar questions.	0	0
433	433	CSTS-UH	1055J	Is Liberalism Dead?	When the Berlin Wall fell, in 1989, it seemed that the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century had come to a decisive end, with liberal democracy emerging the winner. We can now see that this triumphalism was a delusion. The election of Donald Trump constituted a shocking repudiation of liberal values. But those precepts have also been retreating across Europe, and in emerging democracies like Turkey and India. Hostility towards elites, and towards immigrants, outsiders and political minorities has fueled virulent forms of populism. Our world is much darker today than it was only a decade ago. This class will explore the origins of liberalism in the works of thinkers like John Stuart Mill, and the later development of liberal thinking in the twentieth century. It will look at the thrilling advent of liberal democracy in eastern Europe after 1989 then turn to exploring the way globalization, free trade, immigration and the refugee crisis have dissolved this apparently consensual worldview.

434	434	CSTS-UH	1056J	Protecting the World's Health: Triumphs and Challenges	This course exposes students to the key principles and practices of public health using four epidemics as learning tools: the eradication of smallpox, the AIDS epidemic, HPV, and the global epidemic of tobacco use. These four examples offer excellent learning templates for exploring public health because of their diversity: one has ended (smallpox); one has an underutilized vaccine (HPV); one is an infectious disease for which no vaccine exists (AIDS); and one is a fully preventable human-manufactured epidemic (tobacco). The course includes a mix of lectures, class exercises, CSI-like investigation approaches, and site visits and field work in Abu Dhabi and Tanzania. Students become familiar with how an epidemic emerges, what steps can be taken to measure an epidemic’s scope and distribution, how epidemiologists (the detectives of public health) go about determining the source of an epidemic, the role research plays in answering questions with respect to source and cure, how public health leaders work to arrest an epidemic, and the interplay between society, culture, politics, and health.	0	0
435	435	CSTS-UH	1057J	Religion and the Boundaries of Tolerance	This course focuses on three distinct but related questions: What is “religion” and why does it pose a special challenge to theories of toleration? How do different theories of toleration justify its boundaries? What are the challenges in institutionalizing toleration in legal forms? After exploring definitions of key terms religion and toleration, the course will turn to related legal questions: Should religious sentiments be protected in free speech jurisprudence? Does legal pluralism in personal law protect or hinder toleration? Theoretical readings will include selections from Locke, Hume, Gandhi, Iqbal, Rawls, and others. Other materials will come from major religious traditions, comparative politics, anthropology, and legal cases drawn from India, the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, the course offers a framework for thinking about debates over toleration in a wide range of countries, including the UAE’s recently announced Charter for Toleration. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to India.	0	0
436	436	CSTS-UH	1058JX	God or Reason? The Controversy over Law	Law lies at the center of a conflict between religious and secular claims about how to organize our personal and communal lives. While this conflict has assumed violent form in Muslim countries, religious law’s ramifications for public space affects even “Western” societies, including Israel. The conflict also renews a classic debate over the source of law, over whether and how the religious and the rational can be reconciled. Is reason - or even “common sense” - law’s source or merely its instrument? This course focuses on some arguments from the medieval - especially Muslim - tradition that broach the same subject. Additional readings, whether Averroes, Habermas, or a contemporary ISIS tract, will guide students to appreciate more fully what is at stake in the religious turmoil presently afflicting modern states, especially in this region.	0	0
437	437	CSTS-UH	1059X	Urban Violence: The Middle East	This course explores actors, narratives, experiences, and historical processes that have combined to produce violent cities and societies in the last century. Using the modern and contemporary Middle East as a case study, it addresses a number of salient questions arising from the relentless global advance of sprawling urbanization, conflict, and social inequality. How can we interpret the increasingly close relationship between violence and the city in the 20th and 21st centuries? Can understanding past histories of violence open up new areas of urban activism and public engagement? Can we study, debate, and represent urban violence without offending its past and present victims? Aiming to territorialize and historicize the “urban” as an analytical category, the course scrutinizes the role of cities as frameworks for ordering knowledge, experience, power, inequality, suffering, and civility in the modern world.	0	0
438	438	CSTS-UH	1060	Religion and Philosophy	An examination of various questions that arise in philosophical discussions of religion, such as: Can philosophical reflection help us to prove the existence of God or clarify such puzzling matters as God’s relationship to time? How could a benevolent and omnipotent God permit the existence of evil and misfortune? Is it ever rational to form beliefs about matters which transcend the realm of the empirical? Is the concept of a specifically religious experience a coherent one? If not, can religious beliefs be supported by other means? Alternatively, is the entire project of evaluating religious discourse as a set of claims about transcendent realities misguided? What should we make of the different explanations of religion and religious phenomena offered by philosophers from al-Farabi to Marx and Nietzsche?	0	0
439	439	CSTS-UH	1061	Global Ethics	This course aims to accomplish two things. The first is to introduce three broad traditions of normative thinking about social issues from around the globe: a Confucian tradition, one based in Islamic legal traditions, and one derived from European liberalism. The second is to address three current areas of normative debate: about global economic inequality, about gender justice, and about human rights. Students will explore these ethical controversies against the background of the three broad traditions. The aim of the course will be to understand some of the differences of approach that shape the global conversation about these issues.	0	0
440	440	CSTS-UH	1062	Urbanization and Development	Where do cities comes from? How do they develop? This course reviews the history of cities from prehistoric times to the middle ages and then on to contemporary urbanization in both the advanced and less developed worlds. The role of medieval cities as cradles of capitalism and state-building will receive particular attention. This will be followed by a summary review of the successive cycles of world economic development under Spanish, Dutch, British, and then American hegemony. How cities evolved during each of these cycles and how they harbored and nurtured multiple economic and political changes that ushered the modern world will be examined. The final part of the course will be dedicated to contemporary urbanization in the post-industrial cities of the United States and Europe and the major capitals of the less developed world. The character and significance of “global cities” will be discussed, comparing established ones such as New York and London with emerging ones, in particular Dubai and Miami. Topics include the rapidly growing economic and social inequalities in cities, both of the advanced and less developed nations, and to the role of the informal economy in both.	0	0
441	441	CSTS-UH	1063	Power, Domination, and Resistance	What is power? It is ubiquitous in all societies, but there is little consensus about how it should be defined, measured, and explained. This class draws on several disciplines, and a range of materials including academic essays, films, short stories, novels, and poems to explore the many dimensions of power. We begin with general theoretical debates, then examine the dynamics of power at all levels of social life, from interpersonal interaction to global economic hegemony. We explore power in families, in gender relations, in conflicts between racial and ethnic groups, power in the capitalist economy, in different types of political systems, and in geopolitics and warfare. The last section of the class focuses explicitly on resistance to power – from changing laws to social movements and revolutions.	0	0
442	442	CSTS-UH	1064J	Well-Being and the Design of the Built Environment	We now have considerable evidence that the design of our cities, neighborhoods and buildings affects how we feel, how we behave, and how much physical activity we get, and these have a direct influence on our health and well-being.  Drawing on literatures and approaches from public health, urban planning, architectural design, sociology, psychology and neuroscience, students will be challenged to consider the effect of the built environment on our well-being.  A social justice framework guides the analysis of technical issues. The insights gained will benefit future designers, but also those who choose careers as policy makers and health practitioners; who employ architects for residential and workplace projects; and who, as citizens and activists, hope to make the places in which they live, work and relax better for everyone.  Readings include case studies from Europe and North America, and new research from the Gulf.  Students will learn through interactive classroom lectures; student-led discussions and presentations; the screening and discussion of documentary films and TED talks; two field visits in Abu Dhabi; and by conducting two small ethnographic projects on campus.	0	0
443	443	CSTS-UH	1066	Feminist Theory in a Globalizing Context	What is feminist theory and what is its relevance to our world today? What compulsions and reservations do some people have around the “F” word? Can gender be theorized across cultures in ways that adequately address inegalitarian sociopolitical and economic conditions? A body of thought that arose to explain how gender creates social meaning, feminist theory has evolved to address the political impacts of gender’s intersection with race, class, nationalism, sexual orientation, and other categories. Its interdisciplinarity allows for broad applicability and has secured ongoing relevance for global civic engagement. The course begins with a look at “first wave” or “liberal” feminism’s battles for women’s economic, political, and domestic parity with men before examining how post-structural feminist and queer theory has questioned the very basis of gender difference as social construct. How have rights-based approaches to equality provoked socialist and Marxist, postcolonial, or Islamist critiques? Can feminist theory confront the ethical imperative for global citizens to improve conditions for everyone regardless of sex, gender, race, class, or creed?	0	0
444	444	CSTS-UH	1067	Moving Target	Cities are constantly on the move. Half the world’s population lives in urban areas, with numbers steadily rising. How have cities depended on, and been shaped by, such mobility? What will future systems of movement look like? Can emerging technologies and information networks increase sustainability in urban transport? Can we develop prosperous, safe, and connected cities while also managing impacts on climate and public health? Bringing global and critical perspectives to bear on such questions, the course reckons with the realization that optimal mobility systems are a constantly moving target. Drawing on material from multiple disciplines, students will examine changes and challenges throughout history and across regions as they ask how mobility shapes cities, how physical mobility relates to “upward” social mobility, and how planners and citizens might better address the mobility needs and wellbeing of diverse groups. Students will engage in ongoing debates and will explore different media (e.g. animations, posters, videos, photography, essays) to address such questions.	0	0
445	445	CSTS-UH	1069Q	Biology of Politics	Aristotle famously referred to humans as “political animals,” meaning we develop and live in social contexts. But might political instincts and behavior actually have biological origins? Why are some people more politically active than others? Do conservatives and liberals have different physiologies? Social scientists have traditionally focused on demography, socioeconomic status, mobilization, electoral institutions, parental socialization, and social norms to understand political attitudes and behavior. New research, however, explores the possibility that biological differences may help to explain variations in political beliefs and participation. This course explores the relationship between biology and politics with an emphasis on how the two may be linked. In addition to examining the theoretical arguments used to study the biological basis of political beliefs and behaviors, students will examine concepts from genetics, neuroscience, psychophysiology, psychology, and evolutionary theory. How might the findings reported in this growing interdisciplinary literature help us better account for our own and others’ political dispositions?	0	0
446	446	CSTS-UH	1070J	Justice, Membership, and Migration	This course takes up the moral and practical dimensions of one of the world’s greatest current problems: the increased migration flows affecting Europe and North America, and states near conflict zones, such as Lebanon and Turkey. Do we have special moral obligations to our fellow citizens? If so, what are they, and what is their basis? What are our moral duties and obligations to human beings generally and to those, in particular, who seek to migrate to for the sake of economic advancement or to flee persecution or dire poverty? If our special moral obligations to our fellow citizens conflict with various duties to outsiders, which take priority? When are “guest worker” programs morally acceptable? Is there a “brain drain”? We will consider competing moral frameworks for thinking about these issues, including “free market” views, utilitarian and cosmopolitan views, nationalism, and social justice, and study what is actually happening. Many class sessions will be organized as debates, with students presenting different sides of an issue in light of our readings.	0	0
447	447	CSTS-UH	1071J	Biotechnology and Society	Can science and social planning work together to address major issues in the developing world, such as hunger and unequal access to health care? Molecular biology, paving the way for biotechnology and the establishment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), has enabled major breakthroughs towards crop improvement and in treating diseases such as diabetes. Such developments have clear benefits for our society but they have also raised global issues concerning equality and the environment. This course approaches the link between life sciences and society with such ethical questions in mind. Where do GMOs come from? What regulations are needed to ensure that they serve the right purpose at all layers of society? How do we prevent polarization of resources in this field? The first part of the course will examine the science, economics, and politics behind biotechnology and evaluate the ethical issues that arise from this fast-developing area of research. The second part of the course considers India, where biotechnology has played and continues playing a central role in development.	0	0
448	448	CSTS-UH	1072J	Surveillance, Sousveillance, and the Politics of Memory and Space	Surveillance, looking from above, is the right to inspect exercised by CCTV, biometrics, policing of the marginalized, drones, border checkpoints, web algorithms and the political-cultural engineering of historical memory that fashions historical forgetfulness. Sousveillance, looking from below, generates cultural counter-memory through mobile personal media, on-line activism, street art, urban subcultures, political occupations, and alternative archives pitted against social inequity, human rights violations and censored history. What happens when these conflictual gazes now watch each other? Does the act of seeing transforming what is seen? These visual cultures will be historically and comparatively engaged through interdisciplinary readings, films and field trips. We will navigate Madrid as a historical laboratory of conflicting visual histories, memories and spatial experience as exhibited in museums, civil war memorials, social activist and artist occupations and underground film archives.	0	0
449	449	CSTS-UH	1073	Law, Media and Changing International World Order	"Historically the law has governed how “the media” operates. Increasingly however, “media” appear as if they are a law unto themselves. Since the law is mainly national, but the media are increasingly transnational, this poses problems for world order that require understanding. This course will discuss shifts in the post WWII world order, as perceived through the category of media, and via issues of international law and justice. ""Media"" present a new category for intellectual inquiry in general; its importance has changed from enabling to unsettling the regnant forms of international order."	0	0
450	450	CSTS-UH	1074	Refugees, Law and Crises	How does international law respond to global challenges confronting refugees and states? In recent years 68.5 million men, women, and children worldwide have fled their homes due to conflict, natural disaster, violence, and persecution, amounting to the highest level of forced migration since WWII. Those who manage to cross international borders confront a global refugee system in crisis, with no consensus as to how it should be reformed. This course explores the history of the international refugee regime and the limitations of international law and governance. It asks how the ever-present tension between the sovereign right of states to control their borders and the international duties owed to refugees has influenced the way that international law has been shaped and interpreted by countries across the world’s major regions. Taking a comparative approach via African, Latin American, Asian, European and Middle Eastern case studies, the course will conclude by examining the UN Global Compact for Migration, adopted in December 2018, which provides an occasion for critical analysis of the international community’s attempt to create an effective and humane regime for protecting refugees.	0	0
451	451	CSTS-UH	1075X	Exploring UAE Cities	70 years ago the today’s metropolises of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah were little more than village-like settlements on the shores of the Arabian Gulf. In the wake of the oil boom, however, these settlements quickly transformed into modern cities, later becoming – due to the massive influx of expat workers – large-scale urban agglomerations (with 1 to 3M inhabitants). The UAE’s metropolises stand out due to the tremendous pace with which they globalized, but these developments have also given rise to a variety of social problems and challenges. This seminar approaches these problems by examining the social fabric in each of these cities. How are UAE urban spaces marked by differences of social class, gender, ethnic and national affiliations, and religion? What kind of community spaces have emerged in past and present? What can their built environments teach us about local histories of inter-ethnic relationships? In what ways do urban built environments reflect state politics? Can UAE cities expand endlessly, and with what consequences for natural and social environments? What can these cities teach us about the social politics and future of urban life in general?	0	0
452	452	CSTS-UH	1076	What Is Property?	Why is property key to so many societies and social institutions? How do various understandings of its origins, definitions and limitations, distributions and regulations sit at the core of current debates about the environment, fairness and equality, the public and the private, the private and the commons, and more broadly the future of liberal societies? Focusing on the western legal tradition and its increasingly global implications, this course critically approaches various theories of property while constantly attending to contemporary debates about the institution and its legitimacy. The method is genealogical. After a brief presentation of premodern conceptions, the course will follow the rise and triumph of the canonical definition of Property as a subjective, absolute and exclusive right, through the careful study of conflicting theories about its nature, origins, grounds, purposes. What challenges have these canonical definitions faced—whether through social, analytical, or realist critique—and what implications do current ways of theorizing property have for its future?	0	0
453	453	CSTS-UH	1077	Law and Politics	Is law above politics? When lawyers act according to ideological and political preferences, we think they betray the law. But we also often wish to be politically more autonomous, that is to be the authors of the laws we are subjected to. When the law is made only by lawyers and only based on legal technique, we think some important principles of political freedom are lost. This course aims to inquire about this paradox. To do so, the course will begin with a moment, at the end of the 18th century, when realizing political autonomy came by exiting the western legal tradition, but through law, imagining something like a “law without lawyers.” It will then study the reaction to and internalization of this project by eminent Jurists. In what ways has the resulting status quo defined the structure of modern law and legal science? Does raising such a question depend on an ongoing negotiation between law and politics? What narratives might we develop in order to understand the roles played by law and legal science (and their critique) in establishing supposedly politically autonomous societies?	0	0
454	454	CSTS-UH	1078	Networks	How do the various social, technological, and other networks in which humans live shape our behavior, agency, knowledge, beliefs, and preferences? Is it possible to map or otherwise quantify the ways in which these networks - of friends, media and information, biological and chemical processes, transportation - both facilitate and are shaped by various converging or diverging patterns of human sociality? Such general questions have been taken up within a range of disciplines in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Although there are multiple approaches and answers put forward within these different domains, they all share a basic vocabulary. This course aims to convey and allow students to explore this common vocabulary of formal concepts and processes related to understanding networks. They will do so by taking up tools for making elementary computations as they experiment with their own scenarios for analyzing the complex patterns of relationships that shape our lives.	0	0
455	455	CSTS-UH	1079	Language and Society	How does language shape our thoughts—and our societies? Language facilitates abstract thinking and enables interpersonal communication. But some tension exists between its individual and social effects. Communication systems are shared, but individuals have distinct identities, experiences, and things to say. They have different versions of a language and do different things with it. At the macro-social level, policy planning, official languages, and language education both help and hinder efforts to promote human understanding and international cooperation. Exploring such contrasting imperatives, the course asks: How does language create and perform identity? How does it reflect social organization and order? How are communication or conflict enabled or affected by language change or the emergence of dialects or social registers? Students will explore research methods to study dynamics of linguistic conformity (social norms and institutions, power dynamics) and individual usage (language acquisition, personal networks, stylistic variation, and social accommodation) that bear on our efforts to understand language as a defining human characteristic.	0	0
456	456	CSTS-UH	1080J	Environmental Justice and Urban Inequality	The poor, immigrants, and people of color—who are increasingly clustered in global “mega-cities”—are exposed to a disproportionate share of environmental hazards. In this course, we trace the origins of the uneven distribution of environmental problems across urban geographies, examine ways to measure environmental inequality, and analyze how environmental issues shape social inequality. We also survey the historical emergence of the global environmental justice [EJ] movement, led by residents of underserved urban communities who felt excluded by mainstream environmentalism, and explore how political and technocratic visions for achieving sustainability mitigate or worsen inequality. The readings span the social sciences and history. We will explore case studies of environmental inequality and EJ initiatives from around the globe, with special attention to the UAE. Of particular interest is Masdar City, the UAE’s attempt to construct the world’s first carbon-neutral city. Based on a site visit, analyses of plans, and a critical reading of the literature regarding Masdar City, we will ask what Masdar can teach us about achieving EJ in the 21st century.	0	0
457	457	CSTS-UH	1081J	What is a Religion?	Most English-speaking people can answer the question, “What is your religion?” … even if the answer is “I am an atheist, so I don’t have one.” Yet the things we call religions are remarkably diverse. They differ, for example, in whether they address one God, no gods or many; how important they think explicit creeds are; how much attention they give to prayer, fasting and other rituals; and whether adherents are expected to dress or eat or engage in other everyday practices in a distinctive way. In this course we’ll discuss the views of a variety of anthropologists, philosophers and sociologists as to what religions are; theories that seek to explain not just what, if anything, these many diverse religions have in common but the moral, social or cognitive purposes they serve. Among our theorists will be some of the founders of modern Western social science—E. B. Tylor, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim. Among our questions will be, “Is religion a European concept?”	0	0
458	458	CSTS-UH	1083J	Year of Tolerance	In late 2018 the leaders of the UAE declared that 2019 would be the “Year of Tolerance.” So far the year has lived up to its name, having seen the visit of Pope Francis and the laying of the foundation stone of the UAE’s first traditional Hindu temple. Amid the various celebrations of coexistence, however, there has been relatively little discussion of the underlying idea. What is tolerance, and why is it a good thing? The answers to these questions may seem obvious: for those of us already invested in peaceful coexistence with members of different religions, the benefits of tolerance are clear. But what about people who are not yet committed to coexistence? Are there defenses of tolerance that even people who reject the idea that all religions are equally valid or valuable might find compelling? Can we, in other words, find arguments for tolerance that speak to fundamentalists? If not, can we nevertheless organize society in a genuinely tolerant manner without thereby being intolerant of more traditional or conservative ways of life? These are just some of the questions with which we will grapple as we look back over the Year of Tolerance.	0	0
459	459	CSTS-UH	1084J	Art and Science of Parenting: Impact on Education, Health, and Mental Health	After spending our early lives with our parents, what can we say about how they influenced our personalities and development? How have our parents affected what we learn, how we act, and how we manage our health and mental health? Just as you have wondered about these questions, so have scientists and professionals. We study parenting styles in detail to identify qualities that foster healthy child development. The course reviews research on the importance of parenting practices within a family context. We will discuss how parents and parenting practices have been presented in popular culture and the arts to determine if those depictions are accurate and fair. The presentations in varied cultures around the world and within countries will be reviewed.  Students also learn how to interact effectively with parents, how to mobilize parents, and what efforts have been successful in changing detrimental parenting actions. This course is for the curious and those interested in careers in education, health, and mental health. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.	0	0
460	460	ECON-UH	1112	Principles of Macroeconomics	(Formerly ECON-AD 102)This course offers an introduction to the study of aggregate economies in the long and short runs of time. The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions. The course concludes with descriptions of the tensions inherent in the formulation of monetary and fiscal macroeconomic policies and the pitfalls and opportunities afforded to nations within the context of an emergent global economy.This course is required only for students following the 2016-2017 bulletin or earlier bulletins.This course will be offered for the last time in Spring 2018.	0	0
461	461	ECON-UH	1410J	Research Design, Fieldwork, and Data Analysis for Development Economics	Close to 1 billion of the world’s population live on less than what is effectively 99 US cents a day. A child born in Sub-Saharan Africa is 10 times more likely to die as an infant than a child born in the US, largely of biologically preventable illnesses. One in four Indians are illiterate. Are these facts necessary? What has and can be done to change them? Topics in development economics are concerned with the pursuit of understanding facts and questions like these. This is a challenging introductory course for college students who are motivated to learn more about what can be done in the fight against global poverty and who are ready for a busy few weeks of intense learning and skill development in research design, fieldwork, and data analysis for development economics.	0	0
462	462	ECON-UH	1501	Managerial Economics	New York City is one of the top world business centers. The City bustles with business since its foundations in the 1600s, and the dynamics of business are felt in every one of its streets at any time of the day. The dynamics also reflect the success or failure of business units. Success in business depends on market positioning and the management of internal resources. Through the lens of economics, students will learn to think systematically and strategically about critical management issues concerning consumer demand, costs, pricing, market competition, and organizational incentives. Lectures will be interspersed with games and case discussions to allow a more direct immersion in business situations.	0	0
463	463	ECON-UH	1550J	Euro-American Financial System in Crisis	"Modern European and American finance has evolved into a highly liberalized, interconnected, and globalized system that depends on markets and banks as intermediaries between users and suppliers of capital. The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks - the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the ""vicious downward cycle"" caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics."	0	0
464	464	ECON-UH	1701	Economics of Gender	The role of women in the economy changed drastically in the 20th century. Many women around the world enjoy unprecedented freedom to decide what to study, where to work, and when to have a family, nowadays. These changes coupled with the evidence of a persistent gap in the earnings of men and women around the world raise important questions about family planning, female participation in the labor force, and public policy. These questions are at the center of this course. That is, we will explore how men and women make decisions about work and family that have a long-lasting impact on their lives. Using insights from economic theory and empirical data —predominantly from Europe, the USA and the UAE— the course covers topics such as the different incentives for men and women to study and participate in the labor market, as well as explore the reasons behind gender differences in earnings and employment. Students will learn about trends in fertility and marriage rates, and discuss recent government policies aimed at combating discrimination, encouraging women to participate in the labor force, and achieving a better work-life balance.	0	0
465	465	ECON-UH	2010	Intermediate Microeconomics	This course introduces the major concepts and tools of modern microeconomic analysis. Students will study the manner in which consumers, producers and resource owners, acting through markets, determine the prices and output of goods and the allocation of productive resources. Consumers and producers are viewed as agents with well-defined objectives, choosing optimally under constraints on their resources. The price mechanism is viewed as an institution that disseminates information to decision makers—firms and consumers—and coordinates their behavior. Students will study circumstances under which markets promote an efficient allocation of resources, as well as sources of market failure where the price mechanism can lead to inefficient outcomes.	0	0
466	466	ECON-UH	2020	Data Analysis: Economics	Social Science research and policy analysis rely heavily on observational data. Students learn to analyze such data and apply appropriate statistical techniques to address various empirical questions. Topics include multivariate regression and classification analysis as well as time series modeling and forecasting. The course emphasizes applications of these techniques using statistical software.	0	0
467	467	ECON-UH	2030	Intermediate Macroeconomics	Intermediate Macroeconomics addresses in depth four foundational aspects of macroeconomic theory and policy: (1) theories of exogenous and endogenous growth in per capita incomes; (2) theories of fluctuations in output, employment and other macroeconomic aggregates with a focus on policy and other economic stimuli that can lead to booms and recessions; (3) determinants of inflation including capacity constraints, money, credit and expectations; (4) the aims, objectives and tools of monetary and fiscal policies and their relationship with financial intermediation and its regulation. Throughout the course data will regularly be analyzed to critically assess the theoretical insights.	0	0
468	468	ECON-UH	2310EQ	Behavioral Economics	This course introduces students to the field of behavioral economics, which seeks to combine standard economic thinking with more psychologically-plausible assumptions about human behavior. This is accomplished by making nonstandard assumptions about human preferences, exploring nonstandard beliefs, and emphasizing the limitations of our decision-making faculties. Predictions about individual behavior are more accurate and the policies of governments are more effective when these more-realistic models are effectively used. The topics covered include, but are not restricted to, choice under uncertainty, overconfidence and competitiveness, stereotypes and discrimination, moral and social norms, and procrastination and intertemporal choice. Each topic is approached by examining evidence that is not easily explained by the canonical economic model and then asking how and why it can be better explained by making specific deviations from the standard rationality assumptions. Specific policy interventions that can be used to help people make better decisions will also be discussed.	0	0
469	469	ECON-UH	2321J	Economic Rationality and Behavior	This class provides the insights and tools to understanding human behavior, the limits of human rationality and how public policies can be designed to improve well-being taking into account rationality and its limitations. The course will be based on readings from the empirical literature, showing empirical regularities in human behavior. Data analysis on various examples such as criminal activity, the determinants of car accidents, the role of television on the development of cognitive skills of kids or the role of public policies (education, development and health) will be used do draw first principles of human behavior.  From these principles, it develops a theory of human interactions and develops welfare criteria to assess the efficiency and inefficiencies of these interactions and economic equilibria. It then studies various topics: the regulation of firms, the art market, bubbles, city development, discrimination. NOTE: This course is better suited for students having never studied economics before, but students with prior knowledge are also welcome.	0	0
470	470	ECON-UH	2322E	Neuropsychoeconomics	The course presents an introduction to new methods and techniques and recent results from the fields of Psychoeconomics and Neuroeconomics. We will discuss alternative models of decision making arising in psychology, as e.g. prospect theory or dual-process theories, and the process data on which they are based, as e.g. response times. Special emphasis will be placed on neuroscientific techniques as fMRI and the EEG. The discussion of the techniques will be focused on examples where they have been applied to specific microeconomic settings, ranging from intertemporal decision making to prosocial behavior. Other exemplary topics covered in the course include self-control depletion and the effects of time pressure and cognitive load.	0	0
471	471	ECON-UH	2410	Development Economics	This course covers the roles of factor accumulation, technology, human capital and ideas in the growth process; the political economy of growth; the role of openness to international trade versus international trade barriers; and growth and income inequality. The course provides an overview of foreign aid in the economic development process and the policies of international institutions like the IMF and World Bank. The course also includes: the study of randomized experiments in evaluating aid projects and development interventions; rural land markets; credit markets in imperfect and fragmented capital markets; the household migration decision; and nutrition and fertility decisions.	0	0
472	472	ECON-UH	2411	Technology and Economic Development: Markets and Networks	This course will cover topics on the interface between economics and computer science, with special emphasis on issues of importance to economically developing regions. Students will work in teams to tackle real-world and interdisciplinary problems.

473	473	ECON-UH	2451X	Economic History of the Middle East	The Middle East was the cradle of civilization and one of the most vibrant regions of the world for thousands of years. Since the Middle Ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region’s experience?	0	0
474	474	ECON-UH	2502J	Household Finance	Household Finance is the field of study of how individuals make their financial decisions: how they choose a mortgage to buy a house, how they decide to invest their savings, how much insurance coverage they want to undertake, whether households have the financial capabilities to make sound decisions and how they do when confronted with financial markets and individuals. This course reviews the academic literature on households’ financial decisions, focusing on the determinants of investors’ financial choices. It will show how people’s preferences and attitudes towards risk, regret and ambiguity affect their choices and how these can be measured. The course emphasizes the role of informal institutions – such as trust and social capital – in shaping the adoption of financial instruments and the functioning of retail financial markets.	0	0
475	475	ECON-UH	2510	Foundations of Financial Markets	This course offers a rigorous examination of the basic concepts and tools of modern finance. Students are introduced to cash flow analysis and present value, as well as basic concepts of return and risk, in order to understand how financial markets work and how financial instruments are valued. These instruments, including equities, fixed income securities, options, and other derivative securities, become vehicles for exploring various financial markets and their utilization by managers in different kinds of financial institutions to enhance return and manage risk.	0	0
476	476	ECON-UH	2511	Financial Systems	Recent global financial turbulence has demonstrated both how important the financial system is to the world economy and how complex it is. Financial systems are centered on key institutions, instruments and markets. But they also involve governments, public policy and regulation. They span the globe from the US, the EU, Japan, Russia, China and the Emerging Markets. In critical ways, country-­‐level financial architectures are integrating to form a more seamless, high-­‐performance whole. This is good for efficiency, innovation and growth, yet it also amplifies problems during times of crisis.	0	0
477	477	ECON-UH	2512	FinTech Innovation: Finance, Technology, Regulation	FinTech innovation is the hottest topic in Financial Services and touches all aspects of industry transformation. Digitizing a financial institution or competing with established players requires an interdisciplinary approach. For FinTech entrepreneurs and investors to be capable of creating or evaluating innovative business models that can generate revenues they need to possess knowledge on 3 key areas: Finance  (quantitative methods and behavioral finance), Technology (artificial intelligence, blockchain, API) and Regulation (MIFID2, PSD2, GRDP). In this course we will cover these key three areas and study their implications for FinTech founders and investors, established financial institutions and regulators.	0	0
478	478	ECON-UH	2513J	Social Entrepreneurship for Economic Development : India	Social Entrepreneurship for Economic Development (SEED): India.  The development of homegrown, community-owned business is a critical element for the economic success of any society, and yet it is not a major area of focus for development institutions and nonprofits in their work with vulnerable populations around the world.  Social Entrepreneurship for Economic Development (SEED), India is a unique educational experience that will combine business theory and experiential learning in an effort to harnesses the talents of low-income populations to generate sustainable businesses. The objectives are to (1) develop prototypes or minimum viable products that can help solve a social need in a rural community in India, and, with this foundation, (2) develop an entrepreneurship module for the volunteer staff of one of India’s leading education-oriented nonprofits, Educate Girls.  SEED will also build on the experiences of NYU’s Stern International Volunteers (Ghana) course, which has helped incubate several community-owned businesses and educational initiatives in rural Ghana.	0	0
479	479	ECON-UH	2514	Economics of Sovereign Wealth Funds	Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are key actors in the global financial landscape of the twenty-first century.  These funds manage assets worth more than 7 trillion of US dollars and have grown more rapidly than any other class of large global investors—and thus appear set to strongly influence international investing for the foreseeable future. Yet, in spite of their size and relevance, SWFs are still quite poorly understood. What explains their momentous rise? What is the economic rationale for their establishment? How do they differ from other global institutional investors? Which economic, institutional, and governance challenges to they face? Against this backdrop, this course will introduce the student to the economic principles of sovereign investing and to key, selected problems and issues in sovereign wealth management in the international context and with special reference to the UAE, home of some of the leading SWFs.	0	0
480	480	ECON-UH	2610	International Economics	Examining both macro and micro aspects of the globalization of world economies, this course begins with the fundamentals of trade: comparative advantage, gains from trade, the price of factors of production, and the implications of labor and capital mobility. The second part of the course covers the role of money and finance in global economic activity. Topics include: the roles of the exchange rate; current and capital accounts as key variables in international economic relations; purchasing power parity and interest rate parity; the international effects of macro policy and government exchange rate policies; the role of oil exports in the world economy; and the role of international economic organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.	0	0
481	481	ECON-UH	2620J	Understanding Financial Crises	The purpose of this course is to understand the key facts and basic mechanisms concerning financial crises and related topics. The course will first begin by studying empirical evidence about financial crises as well as the basic crisis mechanisms (bank runs, sovereign default decision, currency collapse). The empirical facts will provide a perspective on the recurrence of different types of financial crises (banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises). Students will study their causes, their resolutions, and their long-run consequences. The crisis mechanisms will be introduced through very simple canonical models, with emphasis on intuition and insight over model technicalities. Once these foundations are in place, the course will open up on a series of topics with mixed themes such as crises and long run growth; inequality and crises; crises, stabilization and reforms. An in-depth study of major crises episodes, such as the Great Depression, the US Financial Crises of 2007–2008, and the Euro Crisis will be offered. The classes will be complemented by visits to Washington, D.C. institutions and by exchanges with officials who played a key role during past financial crises.	0	0
482	482	ECON-UH	2621J	Crises, Policies and their Aftermath	"The purpose of this course is to review the key facts and understand the mechanisms at work before, during and after financial crises. Located in Paris, a specific focus will be given to European developments in the wake of the sovereign crisis. The course will be divided into two parts. It will start by looking at the main empirical evidence about financial crises. This evidence will be used to establish a ""typology"" around the canonical models of bank runs, sovereign defaults, and currency collapses. These empirical facts and the derived typology will equip students with the tools to analyze the causes of crises, the policy responses that they have triggered, and their long-run economic and financial consequences."	0	0
483	483	ECON-UH	2710	Labor Economics	This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms? How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation? The class will expose students to the basic theoretical models used by economists to tackle these issues. Students will also survey evidence from empirical studies on these topics.	0	0
484	484	ECON-UH	2711	Health Economics	This course will focus on the application of economic principles to examine issues in health economics. The first part of the course will focus on theoretical models of supply and demand for health and health care, and the transformation of health care into health. We will then apply these models to understand how health insurance markets work, the importance of externalities in health and health care, the interaction between markets for health and labor, and the role of government intervention in health care provision. We will also discuss key characteristics of current health care programs in the United States and elsewhere. Overall, this course will be a combination of discussion of important issues in health care, learning models that are helpful in explaining various aspects of health care and understanding what is known empirically. By the end of the course, students should be able to use economic reasoning to think critically about health-related policy issues.	0	0
485	485	ECON-UH	3010	Economics of Imperfect Markets	This course studies causes, consequences, and remedies for market failures.  Causes of market failure include insufficient competition (e.g., monopoly or oligopoly), consumption externalities, the presence of public goods, or the presence of information asymmetries (e.g., adverse selection or moral hazard).	0	0
486	486	ECON-UH	3030	Economic Growth	This course introduces the students to the modern analysis of economic growth by addressing questions such as: What explains the considerable growth in incomes per capita that advanced economies have experienced since the late eighteen century? Why are some countries so much richer than others? Will poor countries close the gap with rich countries? What is the driving force of growth in the long run? Are the benefits of growth equally shared between different social classes? How does government policy affect growth? How do the underlying characteristics of an economy - such as its institutions, skill distribution, and demographic trends - affect its growth rate?	0	0
487	487	ECON-UH	3210	Quantitative Methods of Applied Economics	The purpose of this course is to introduce students to an applied, intermediate level of quantitative and econometric analysis. The first part of the course will focus on multiple regression analysis. The second part covers experimental and non-experimental methods that are often used in empirical research and evaluation. The course is intended to give students hands-on experience with real data and real analysis, helping students become sophisticated consumers of relatively advanced statistical techniques, as well as to provide students practical knowledge to conduct their own empirical analysis. Many applications will use data from developing countries.	0	0
488	488	ECON-UH	3310EJ	Economic Decisions and the Brain	What drives economic decisions? How much risk should you accept, how much money should you save, how should you negotiate with others? Can you trust your gut? Modern research in economics has clearly shown that humans are not fully rational, impulse-free decision makers. But how are decisions actually made then, and how can we improve them? This course will review experimental evidence on the many mistakes and biases that humans fall prey to and look at evidence from psychology and neuroscience illustrating the origins of those mistakes. We will use that evidence to illustrate models of decision making arising from both economics and psychology (for example, expected utility theory vs. prospect theory, exponential discounting vs. hyperbolic discounting). Along the way, we will discuss related evidence from brain scanning and imaging studies and process data (response times, eye tracking) and what they have to say about economic decisions.	0	0
489	489	ECON-UH	3410	Development and Public Policy	This course will cover the international aspects of contemporary economic development and poverty reduction in developing countries, including the various dimensions of globalization (trade, migration, capital movements, knowledge transfer, global public goods ...), the potential conflicts of interest between developing and developed countries, the need for global governance and the role of international organizations.	0	0
490	490	ECON-UH	3450	A History of the Modern World Economy	The modern world economy is marked by large disparities in incomes between countries. Why are some countries rich, while others are poor? This course explores the origins of this “Great Divergence” in living standards between countries, focusing on the way in which geography, colonialism, culture, and globalization have spurred or hindered economic development across the globe.	0	0
491	491	ECON-UH	3460	Poverty	International organizations today define poverty as having to live with less than USD 1.90 a day at the prices observed in advanced countries. With such a definition, there are today a little less than 1 billion poor people in the world, or 13 percent of the global population. With the same definition, there were more than 90 per cent two centuries ago. This seems indeed a huge progress. Yet, there are serious questions behind that definition and those figures. Why USD 1.90 a day? Where does this figure come from? How satisfactory is a definition of poverty that implies that there is practically no poor person in the United States or Europe today? Should poverty be measured with a pure monetary metric? How should the subjective and social aspect of poverty be taken into account? Alternative definitions often paint a much less optimistic landscape, with poverty diminishing much more slowly and in some cases not at all. More fundamentally, how is it the case that, even with the 1.90 USD a day definition, there still are countries today where about half the population is below that level? What are the obstacles these countries face in trying to access a higher standard of living?	0	0
492	492	ECON-UH	3511X	Islamic Economics and Finance	This course provides a foundational understanding of the principles of Islamic economics and mode, products and procedures of Islamic finance. This course familiarizes students with the roles and functionalities of Islamic finance in the context of the financial services industry today.	0	0
493	493	ECON-UH	3512	Global Asset Allocation	This course analyzes the drivers of asset prices and explains how they impact the investment decision process in diversified global multi-asset portfolios. The students will learn to distinguish between macro-economic fundamentals, technical parameters and valuation parameters and how the overall assessment of these indicators impacts the investment decisions. The course will cover portfolio optimization as well as techniques of risk management based on the utilization of derivative instruments. The students will subsequently analyze how specific macro-economic drivers have historically had differentiated impacts across advanced, emerging and GCC markets, observing market movements across risk-on- and risk-off moments (financial crises). Equipped with the tools of asset allocation in global multi-asset portfolios, students will finally use this historical empirical analysis as a basis for identifying global and local risk factors in today’s market context, and discuss ways of how to protect portfolios accordingly. This will be done with a special focus on GCC and Emerging Markets.	0	0
494	494	ECON-UH	3513	Advanced Investments	This course presents classical and modern ideas of finance with an applied focus. Students will master the analytic tools and the financial theory for making smart investments by using stocks and bonds but will also get their hands dirty with the data. The course starts with an overview of important methods from mathematics and statistics, software tools and financial data. It continues with the pricing of bonds and other fixed-income instruments, discusses the risks associated with fixed-income investments, demonstrates the methods to derive zero-coupon yield curves and shows how to hedge interest rate risk. The course then deals with stocks and covers the following topics: Predictability of stock returns, The cross-section of stock returns, Asset pricing theory (utility, discount factors, expected returns, CAPM, ICAPM, APT), Empirical asset pricing methods (time-series predictive regressions, cross-sectional Fama-MacBeth as well as Fama and French regressions). We also study the performance of Mutual funds and Hedge funds. The final session of the course will be devoted to answering questions related to this course that are frequently asked in the job interviews in investment banks.	0	0
495	495	ECON-UH	3520	Corporate Finance	This course introduces the student to selected problems and issues in financial management and corporate financial policy. Topics include: capital budgeting (strategy and techniques associated with the analysis and selection of capital projects, financial forecasting, and financial planning) and corporate finance (the cost of capital and issues associated with raising capital, mergers and acquisitions decisions, corporate bankruptcy, managerial control, and compensation strategies). Problem sets and case studies are integral parts of this course.	0	0
496	496	ECON-UH	3600	Topics in International and Macroeconomics	In this course students work through academic research papers in the area of XX that are closely connected to the research interests of the professor. One of the outcomes is a research proposal that each student prepares. Students can take multiple versions of this course for credit.	0	0
497	497	ECON-UH	3630	Public Economics	This course is about the economic activities of government, largely revenue raising and spending, in a global context. The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).	0	0
498	498	ECON-UH	3710	Economics of Education	This course will study the Economics of Education.  This is an important area of investigation both because of its inherent interest to all of us involved in education and for its policy relevance. The course will use the tools of microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics that you have accumulated over your undergraduate studies. Students will refresh these tools as part of the lectures. The course is organized around traditional economic themes of demand, supply, equilibrium and government policy.	0	0
499	499	ECON-UH	3910	Advanced Microeconomics	Building on the foundations laid down in courses in Microeconomics at the intermediate level, this course provides a thorough treatment of some more advanced questions. The course starts with a careful study of the functioning of markets, culminating with the first and second theorem of welfare economics. The next topics cover an introduction to strategic behavior and game theory, and subsequently a study of market failures under adverse selection and moral hazard. This course involves a more formal analysis than that used in Intermediate Microeconomics. The course is mathematical, and at times proof-oriented. Students should be familiar and comfortable with multivariable calculus and basic linear algebra.	0	0
500	500	ECON-UH	3911	De Gustibus Non est Disputandum	"So called ""non-economic"" aspects like social interactions, trust, solidarity, fairness, emotions or cultural and social norms become increasingly acknowledged in various important economic and social policy areas like crime, ethnic conflicts, gender, the welfare state and economic development, The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic tools of microeconomic analysis and other fields (sociobiology, evolutionary anthropology, network theory, population dynamics) to such issues, emphasizing the role of endogenous preferences, culture, social norms and social interactions and their implications for markets, communities and institutions."	0	0
501	501	ECON-UH	3912	Economics of Networks: Theory and Applications	Our opportunities and our choices are shaped by our connections. The awareness that connections matter leads us to invest in them. And these investments give rise to networks of friendship, the World Wide Web, supply chains, research alliances, transport links, and many other networks which we see around us. These observations have inspired an exciting new research program which examines the origins and the implications of networks. The lectures in this course provide a rigorous introduction to this research.	0	0
502	502	ECON-UH	3920J	Collective Welfare and Distributive Justice	This course explores the contribution of macroeconomic analysis to the normative issues surrounding the design of collective decision processes (voting rules, bargaining protocols), and the fair distribution and exploitation of scarce resources through prices or other market mechanisms. Attention is on the rigorous modeling of individual and collective welfare, and the logical difficulties of combining economic efficiency with the requirements of end-state and procedural justice. Applications include the Gini and other inequality indices, the Borda and Condorcet voting rules, the design of tax schedules, fair division of an inheritance, overcoming the tragedy of the commons, and more.	0	0
503	503	ECON-UH	3940	Advanced Macroeconomics	This course provides a formal study of aggregate, dynamic, stochastic, and economic analysis, with attention paid first to the determination of the level of income, employment, and inflation. Next, the class will examine theories and the policies associated with inflation and hyperinflation, entitlement reforms, and the formation of optimal monetary and fiscal policies. Throughout the course modern computational methods will be introduced and applied to solve economic models.	0	0
504	504	ECON-UH	4000	Economic Policy	Economic policy may be seen as the ultimate goal of economic analysis. How to choose between alternative economic courses in some specific area or at the macroeconomic level? How to tradeoff one policy objective, e.g. equity, versus another, e. g, efficiency? How to take into account political constraints while looking for socially optimal policies? Such is the nature of the questions to be handled in this course, which may be taken as the natural culmination of an economic curriculum. Its aim is to make students familiar with the main contemporary issues in economic policy at national level and to equip them with the analytical instruments to understand what is at stake in policy debates around the world and, ultimately, to form one's opinion about what should be done in particular areas. The course will deal with economic policy issues as applicable to any country, even though special attention will be given to emerging and developing countries. As far as possible, it will also systematically emphasize the distributional consequences of policies and consequent political economy dimension? It will not deal with multilateral issues like trade, migration or environment.	0	0
505	505	ECON-UH	4020	Capstone Seminar	The two-semester seminar is designed to provide a capstone experience.

507	507	ECON-UH	4210	Advanced Econometrics	The course presents advanced econometric methods for cross-sectional, time series and panel data. It introduces estimation methods such as Maximum Likelihood and Generalized Method of Moments for univariate and multivariate linear and nonlinear micro-econometric models, including discrete choice, censored regression and sample selection models. Attention is next turned to time series models, such as stationary ARMA and autoregressive distributed lag models with dynamic causal effects, and issues that arise when nonstationarity is present, such as structural breaks, trends, unit roots and cointegration. The course proceeds to introduce static and dynamic panel data models along with appropriate methodology such as fixed and random effects. It finally considers methods for high-dimensional (“big”) data, such as regularization, principal component and factor analysis, and offers an introduction to non-parametric estimation. The students will apply the methods to real data using appropriate econometric packages such as STATA and R.	0	0
508	508	EDUC-UH	1001J	International Peacebuilding and the Role of Education	This J-Term course explores how state and nonstate actors pursue peace and security and the role that education plays in this process. We review various tools of international peacebuilding including peace agreements, peacekeeping forces, institution building, and humanitarian aid, and examine how education fits into these strategies. We also examine the ways education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. We will look at specific education initiatives such as peace education, Education for All, and citizenship education, but we will focus heavily on refugee education, specifically conducting a 5-day site visit to Jordan to meet with organizations currently supporting Syrian refugee education. We will also study briefly Afghanistan, Guatemala, and the United States. Guest speakers (from e.g., UN, INEE, GCPEA)  will speak about their day-to-day operations and their institutional roles, and students will be asked to prepare questions to interview the guests. Assignments and discussions in class are intended to prepare students both for professional positions designing and implementing education strategies in post-conflict countries as well as for further research in the field.	0	0

581	581	ENVR-UH	1312	Global Debate on Green Growth	In March 2012, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published its influential Environmental Outlook Report to 2050, confirming that the world is faced with an explosive new cocktail of geopolitical challenges: population explosion, environmental degradation, the failure to stop climate change, and the increased competition over limited natural resources. In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. This course will examine how major industrial powers are approaching the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.	0	0

592	592	FILMM-UH	1119J	Socialism on Screen	In its early twentieth-century heyday, Soviet socialism charted a profound alternative to western developmental models of economy and society. Yet not all was going according to plan: in the very countries where socialism was taking root, industrial capitalism had not yet given rise to a new proletarian consciousness. The masses would need to be escorted into History, and cinema, in the words of Trotsky, would become the government’s new church. Early socialist directors produced some of the world’s finest filmmakers, revolutionizing cinematic form through new visions of the political in the aesthetic. This course organizes a critical look at foundational works from across the USSR and its Eastern European satellite states. By taking up film theory and criticism, histories of socialism, and questions of visual culture most broadly, we explore how the vocabularies of state planning from modernity to capitalism to communism played out in everyday life.	0	0
593	593	FILMM-UH	1120J	Media and Memory	Film, video and photography play a vital role in preserving cultural memory. The course studies organizations that collect this material and examines the cultural purposes they serve. It presents theories explaining the human habit of collecting and its relation to memory.  BA is a fascinating site for learning what role media can play in memorialization. The “Dirty War” (1976-1983) still marks its institutions; its impact of censorship and human destruction still shape the daily work of archivists. While grassroots activity insists on the presence of the “disappeared,” cultural institutions, as well as families, can confront the complete loss of an archive. Recently, new laws have supported the establishment of numerous new memory organizations. Museums, artists, and activist groups have found routes to memorialization, through curating or making film; erecting topographies of memory in the physical landscape; building parks of memory at critical sites; and understanding “Things as Bridges” to social experience, e.g. memory and history as graspable through encounters with objects. The course links to broader matters of social justice and human rights.	0	0

601	601	FILMM-UH	1910	Docu-Fiction	Fact may or may not be stranger than fiction, but invariably both exert strong influences in creating narrative. This course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures. The course will include an examination of the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats to create singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. Students will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements, reflecting on how each form complements the other.	0	0

Its central argument is that making and studying are not separate activities that corrupt one another but instead entwined and mutually constitutive activities that augment creativity and curiosity. Assignments encourages students to understand differences between making and studying in non-hierarchical and non-sequential ways. By emphasizing feminist postcolonial transnational indigenous and posthuman approaches the course shifts attention from dominant modes such as flat-on-the-screen time-based commercial films as entertainment to immersive interactive locative auto-generative mobile nonlinear and tactical modes for producing research through arts practice and producing arts practice through research.	0	0
607	607	FILMM-UH	3511	Advanced Filmmaking	In this intensive course, Film and New Media majors will define a research question and explore different iterations of the same theme through different modes of film making. These iterations will be in the form of sketches where students will be encouraged to experiment the same set of ideas/subjects/narratives using different combinations of the tools at their disposal. Different formal choices will lead to entirely new set of explorations and meanings embedded in the same theme. This course attempts to blur boundaries between documentary and narrative film, conceptual and emotive cinema, art and communication. Students are encouraged to reflect on 'what' they want to express and 'how' they intend to express this. But the key motivation for the assignments is to lead students to addressing the question- ‘why’. Why am I making this image and what is my relationship with and responsibility towards this image- this is the core concern that students will grapple with. Students are encouraged to locate their research question within Abu Dhabi or the UAE.	0	0
608	608	FILMM-UH	3512	Short Projects in Cinematography & Directing	This course focuses on developing and producing three short projects: a music video, a short narrative, and a commercial. Students will research the historical development of each project’s form as they develop their work. The course will advance the student’s conceptual and practical knowledge of directing, cinematography, and film production. The course will formally link students to collaborate in post-production with editors and colorists in Principles in Post-Production, and sound designers in Immersive Audio Storytelling. Students will conclude the course by submitting at least one of the projects to regional and global film festivals.	0	0
609	609	FILMM-UH	4110	Film and New Media Studies Capstone Seminar	The Capstone Seminar provides senior Film and New Media Studies majors with the opportunity to research and develop the concept for their senior Capstone Project. Students are encouraged to integrate studies and practice in (a) writing a research paper that explores a historical, cultural, or theoretical question related to film and new media broadly conceived and (b) making an accompanying creative or curatorial project. Such projects must include screen media, such as micro-short films, interactive installations or locative media that involve mobile apps or projection, or take the form of a prototypes for multi-level videogames or interactive narrative or documentary projects. Creative projects must engage with the student’s academic rese arch into both the content and form of their creative project. This course will not include technical instruction. In coordination with their Capstone adviser, students will develop a proposal to be presented to the faculty.	0	0
610	610	FILMM-UH	4501	Film and New Media Practice Capstone Seminar	Required for FNM Practice. Senior FNM students arrive with a Capstone proposal/screenplay. After further development students will produce their Capstone project.  Students are encouraged to integrate studies and practice with the intention of creating a time-based media project, including but not limited to single or multichannel, multi-platform documentary, experimental, live action or animated narrative.  Students are required to crew on their classmates Capstone shoots.	0	0
611	611	FILMM-UH	4901	Film & New Media Capstone Project	The Capstone Projects course in Film and New Media provides seniors with the opportunity to complete a Capstone project, which ranges in form from a research paper to time-based media (narrative, documentary, experimental) or digital object involving an installation or performance (video art, new media art, video game, mobile app, locative media) or a combination of these forms. The course focuses on identifying and articulating the objective of each student’s project through editing, self-assessment, and peer review. Ongoing emphasis will be placed on a writing portfolio, which will include critical analysis of arts practice or a conference version of a research paper. The course prepares students for a defense of the project before a faculty panel and a public presentation of the project. The course also explores topics of interest to future graduates, including festivals, programming, research, and graduate programs.	0	0

617	617	HERST-UH	1100	World Heritage Sites & Universal Collections	What is “World Heritage,” how is it nominated, and by whom? The heritage field has become a complex industry that involves (inter)national prestige, conservation, site management, and museum development. Heritage sites of “Outstanding Universal Value” and prestigious museums with “universal” collections are booming tourist destinations worldwide. Multi-faceted perspectives of heritage underline the proposition that heritage doesn’t just represent a static link with the past, but is part of a dynamic social process that includes an evolving interpretation of “the past” for the use in the present. In this course, students explore and test theoretical conceptions of heritage using case studies and fieldwork on heritage sites and collections in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. These investigations will provide context for understanding cultural heritage’s multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects. The focus for our discussions will be sites and practices that are considered “shared cultural heritage” for their Outstanding Universal Value. But what do these values mean, and for whom? Do they imply that universal human values exist? And what if these values are contested?	0	0
618	618	HERST-UH	1300J	Places of Human Suffering as Global Heritage Sites	Memorials to human suffering attract millions of visitors every year. These heritage sites serve a specific purpose as markers of individual and collective memories of a traumatic past.  Because of the sensitivity of the subject and the complexity of the transnational stakeholder groups, these sites are often highly contested. In this course the creation of this type of heritage will be analyzed through the comparison of different heritage sites associated with human suffering and now inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  Robben Island in South Africa and Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland are still within the realm of living memories while Slave Castles in Ghana and slave dungeons on Zanzibar are not. What impact does distance in time and place have on this type of heritage?  How does the practice of both remembering and forgetting affect the interpretation of these painful heritage sites?	0	0
619	619	HERST-UH	1301J	Cultural Heritage in Conflict Zones and the Responsibility to Protect	Palmyra was one of the great cities of antiquity. For almost two thousand years, its physical remains stood as proud beacons of earlier times. Then suddenly, with the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, much of the ancient city was purposely damaged or destroyed. So too were the Great Mosque of Aleppo and the medieval mausoleums and Sidi Yahia mosque in Timbuktu, Mali. This seminar will explore the reasons cultural heritage has been the target of attacks in recent times and what might be done to protect them. We will consider existing international conventions and statutes and a proposed new international norm. Other topics will include the role of the UN, state sovereignty, humanitarian intervention, Responsibility to Protect (R2P), and counterinsurgency. Visits to the Metropolitan Museum and a group lunch will be included.	0	0
620	620	HERST-UH	1500	Shipwrecks and Seascapes	Shipwrecks hold multiple meanings. For many, shipwrecks embody the romance of the sea and the lure of treasure. For others, shipwrecks can be seen as a unique archaeological phenomenon. More than any other archaeological site, they represent a time capsule, a snapshot of a society at a particular moment in time. This course introduces students to maritime archaeology through an exploration of underwater cultural heritage and through field work and practical application of this relatively young discipline.	0	0
621	621	HERST-UH	2300JX	Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes	In the 17th century the Ya’rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian maritime trade network, that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe leaving behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. The resulting cross-cultural footprints, often considered “shared heritage”, illustrate a global process of connectivity that facilitated exchange of cultural, technological and ideological knowledge. The influence of cultural exchange systems still echo through the Indian Ocean trade nodes such as Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled and in maritime cultures such as the Swahili. But what was the mechanism of exchange? How was it driven? What remains and how is it understood? Can the values such as those applied to World Heritage Sites be used to investigate how shared heritage is created? These fundamental questions steer us towards understanding the origins and principles of multi-layered and multivocal shared heritage, its production and management. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.	0	0
622	622	HERST-UH	2301J	Museum History, Theory, and Practice: Case Study, Florence	This course will study the history and theory of museums, and critical issues facing museums, through an investigation of the cultural institutions of Florence.  Much of the course will be held in museums and other cultural spaces, along with classroom sessions at NYU Florence.  The city of Florence presents a unique opportunity for examining museums.  It is a major museum center and most well-known for its former palaces, civic buildings, and churches displaying masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance. But alongside these well-known monuments are great private house museums and museums of fashion, 20th-century art, science, anthropology, and archaeology.  We will study this range of museum types, addressing their histories and issues of audience, display, collections care, educational mission, and interactive technology.  Among the museums and sites we will visit are the Uffizi Gallery, National Museum of the Bargello, Museo dell’Opera, Palazzo Vecchio, Church of Santa Croce, Museo Stibbert, Museo Galileo, Anatomical Collection of La Specola, National Archeological Museum, Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology, Ferragamo Museum, Museo Novocento, and Palazzo Pitti. In addition to attending all site visits, reading required texts and participating in class discussion, students will write two papers and make one presentation.	0	0
623	623	HIST-UH	1105	Africa in the World	This course is a broad survey of African history. The course will explore the African past in its diversity. Students will explore the continent’s political complexity and social creativity across a period of several millennia. The class will consider the impact of gender, religion, healing practices, trade, mobility, and the environment on major historical developments in Africa before the continent’s colonization by European imperialistic powers, through the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and up to the contemporary period. The course will also introduce students to African history’s methodology and to the use of linguistic, material, and oral sources in the writing of history.	0	0
624	624	HIST-UH	1106	China in the World	China’s rise to global prominence may seem to be a recent event, but it is in fact the product of a longer history of globalization, of which “China,” in various guises, has always been a defining part.  This course introduces and examines those features of history in China that help explain China’s evolving place in the world, including: the geography of empire, military organization, population growth, cultural production, urbanization, technological innovation, gender dynamics, migration and diaspora formation, foreign relations, and, of course, economic development.  Along the way, the course addresses key debates about China’s origins, cartographic contours, and cultural imaginaries, as well as the performative aspects of ethnonyms and toponyms like “China” and “Zhongguo.”	0	0
625	625	HIST-UH	1110	Colonial Latin America and the Atlantic World	This course introduces students to the colonial origins of Latin America and examines their impact on the region’s development until the present. It follows the unfolding and demise of a new social order under European rule over a period spanning from the 16th-century conquest through the early 19th-century wars of independence, highlighting international and global connections that shaped this region’s social, cultural, and political history. Specific topics covered include Pre-Columbian worlds, Indian-European confrontations and negotiations, the Catholic Church and popular religiosity, patriarchy and honor codes, racial dynamics and slavery, the development of capitalism, anti-colonial struggles, imperial rivalry, reform and decline, as well as colonial legacies.	0	0
626	626	HIST-UH	1119	Russia and the World	The course surveys the relationship between modern Russia and the rest of the world from 1917 to the present. It will begin with the Bolsheviks and their dream of worldwide socialist revolution as situated in its international context, the creation and expansion of the Soviet socialist state, the onset and development of Stalin's personal despotism, the experiences and consequences of World War II, and the various postwar reforms. Special attention will be paid to the dynamics of the new socialist society, the connections between Soviet domestic and foreign policies, the economics of the cold war, Soviet orientalism, the 1991 collapse, and the legacies of Soviet empire under Putin.	0	0
627	627	HIST-UH	1120	Silk Roads Past and Present	(Formerly HIST-AD 132)This course will explore the ancient and pre-modern exchange routes, better known as the Silk Routes, that traditionally joined China with the Mediterranean. The area covered by these overland and sea routes witnessed a dynamic exchange of information, ideas, knowledge and technologies, which impacted not only aspects of daily life, but also artistic expression. Ranging from the Bronze Age until the 16th century, and employing an inter-disciplinary approach, we will use archaeological, textual, and art historical sources from across this vast region to illuminate the effects of this history of contact, and to understand how this network facilitated a rich array of cultural encounters that served as a precursor to early globalism.	0	0
628	628	HIST-UH	1125X	South Asia in the Indian Ocean World	This course offers an opportunity for in-depth study of the history and culture of the South Asians who comprise the majority population of the United Arab Emirates. Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.	0	0
629	629	HIST-UH	1130	United States in a Transnational and Global Perspective	Rethinking the traditional narratives of US history, this course explores America’s past from a transnational and global perspective. Chronologically, it covers America’s interaction with the wider world from the earliest European settlements to the present, examining the Colonial Period, the founding of the republic, westward expansion, the Civil War and Reconstruction, as well as the country’s emergence as a global power leading up to World War I, the progressive reform movement, the Great Depression and the New Deal, World War II, the Cold War, and America after 9/11. Readings and classroom discussions focus on the major political, economic, and cultural forces that shaped the process of American nation building, reevaluating the allegedly “exceptional” elements of US history in relation to networks, identities, and events that transcended the nation-state.	0	0
630	630	HIST-UH	2010	History and Globalization	History offers a unique perspective on the process of globalization, by virtue of its insistence that human experience be understood in its spatial and temporal contexts. Rigorous global history questions and even supplants common understandings of globalization as Westernization. But how does history do this, and can a global historical framework enhance all forms of historical, humanistic, and social scientific inquiry? Following an assessment of foundational modern Western frameworks for understanding world history, including those of Marx and Hegel, students examine how and why people around the world have variously embraced and rejected such foundational accounts. Readings address all world regions, including Asia, Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania, and familiarize students with state-of-the-art knowledge about globalization.NOTE: This course maybe taken in place of SOCSC-UH 1011 (GEPS) for Social Science Majors or Minors.	0	0
631	631	HIST-UH	2110	Global Cold War	The subject of this course is the Cold War as global conflict. The course focuses on Europe and the Global South, as well as on the United States and the Soviet Union. The course examines issues in international politics and diplomacy, nuclear rivalry and the culture of the bomb, Cold War economic competition and development policies, and the impact of the Cold War on culture and gender in various countries.	0	0
632	632	HIST-UH	2111	Global Environmental History	What are the major causes of deforestation, pollution, and climate change? When and where did these, and other pressing environmental concerns, have their origins? What can history teach us about how we might best address these issues in the present? This course offers a comprehensive overview of the world’s environmental history with a focus on the period from 1500 C.E. to the present a time marked by a dramatic intensification in the use of land, water, and energy resources. The course’s central goal is to understand the relationships between globalization, natural resource and energy use, and environmental change, and to explain how these relationships unfolded, and continue to unfold, differently in major world regions, including the Gulf. By incorporating material from the fields of ecology, biology, geology, demography, economics, political science, and anthropology, this course also provides students with important historical grounding in the multidisciplinary field of global environmental studies.	0	0
633	633	HIST-UH	2113	Global Sixties	This course explores the artistic and intellectual avant-gardes, counter-cultures and protest movements of the 1960s and the early 1970s from a global perspective, assessing their impact on individual identities, social and gender hierarchies, domestic politics and international relations during the Cold War. It traces the history of the various protest movements and explores a plethora of national experiences with respect to domestic and transnational networks of dissent as well as global imaginaries. Taking into account the aesthetics and performativity of protest, the course examines the role of cultural practices, action repertoires, the media, visual representations, lifestyle and fashion, the politics of memory, and the impact of dissent on political decision-makers and society at large.	0	0
634	634	HIST-UH	2114	Urbanism and Modernity: Paris, Istanbul, Berlin	This course explores the emergence of the “modern city” in three significant urban centers (Paris, Istanbul, Berlin) in relation to the demographic, economic, and political pressures of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Attention is given to the foundations of community, the changing uses of public space, the appearance of new strategies of urban planning, and the contested process of defining the “modern” within a specific local culture.	0	0
635	635	HIST-UH	2115	World War II in Global Perspective	The Second World War was the most destructive in human history and has become a touchstone for historical understanding in the postwar period. This course seeks to examine not only the strategic decisions of major belligerent states (Germany, the Soviet Union, Japan, Britain and the United States), but also the transformative power of the war in societies across the globe. Course topics will include the experience of soldiers and civilians, the mobilization of populations within far-flung empires, the use of new weapons and occupation strategies, and the critical social and political consequences of the war on populations across Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and the Middle East.	0	0
636	636	HIST-UH	2116	Empires and Museums: A History of Knowledge Production and Museum-making	"The course will explore the beginning of colonial museums in Europe, in particular the early museums established in Britain, France, Belgium and Netherlands in the 19th and the 20th centuries. Set against the backdrop of empire building, the course will discuss how museum spaces, collections, display and labeling of objects was planned to fit the colonial ideology of racial supremacy and territorial conquest on the one hand, and establish the ""otherness‟ of the colonial subjects on the other. The museums were also meant to display the ""splendours‟ of the colonies such as crafts, flora, fauna and minerals, produce knowledge about the acquired territories as well as disseminate this knowledge among museum visitors. Finally, the course will shift the focus to colonial museums of South Asia and analyse how museum-making has shaped the way in which we understand the history and heritage of these former colonies and how these museums are being restructured in the present day, post-colonial world.”"	0	0

638	638	HIST-UH	2118	Global Asia Before Modernity	Global Asia defines Asia as a space of perpetual globalization and explores Asiansocieties, cultures, and political economies as they have been shaped by dynamic historical processes which expand human connectivity and transform territorial formations of power and authority. Pre-modern Global Asia embraced regions all around the old Silk Roads and Indian Ocean, from ancient times. In this course, we study the evolution of Asian worlds of mobility that Europeans sought to join in the fifteenth century and Asia’s spatial subsequent expansion in worlds of empire up to the onset of industrial capitalism. This course thus provides students with a long-term view of History and a broadly transnational understanding of Asian History in the development of the modern world.	0	0
639	639	HIST-UH	2120	Thinking Big about the Ancient World	"Scholars across academic disciplines have begun to ""think big"" in new ways about the Ancient World. By recasting ideas and events that seem historically remote,  the deep past becomes more relevant than ever to understanding our present.  Did globalization begin in the ancient world?  Was there an early anthropocene?  Can our current crisis of global sustainable development be traced back to the origins of agriculture? Are there ancient world origins to the forms of social inequality we struggle to overcome today, and can our struggles succeed if we overlook what came first?  Finally, what can we learn from studying the collapse of ancient civilizations, as we contemplate the possibility of our own? Incorporating readings and materials from across the disciplines, this class will explore foundational questions about continuities between the ancient and modern worlds."	0	0
640	640	HIST-UH	2290	Topics in Global History	Course topics may include: slavery; world history of science and technology; global history of women and gender; labor migrations; global revolutions; history of the modern city; empire and globalization; the industrial age; consumption and modernity; pirates and piracy in world history; opium; and others.	0	0
641	641	HIST-UH	2715JX	Arab Crossroads: Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, and Beyond: The Mongol Empire and its Legacy	The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. This course examines the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective placing a great deal of emphasis on the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Among the main themes of the class are the rise of Genghis Khan and the history of the Mongol Empire and its impact on the peoples, societies, economies, cultures, and religions of Eurasia and the Indian Ocean. We also ask why did the Mongols set out of Mongolia in the 13th Century to conquer the world? Did they use dolphin fat in their weapons? And how many people alive today are descendants of Genghis Khan? How do the new sciences of DNA studies and modern science of Paleo-climatology help us studies Mongol History? Why was Hitler obsessed with Genghis Khan and why does it matter? NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Uzbekistan.	0	0
642	642	HIST-UH	3010	Writing History	How is history written? This course offers a survey of the major theories and practices that have defined history as a scholarly discipline, and as a way of writing, over the last fifty years. Students are introduced to the major theoretical and narrative perspectives that have shaped historiography: to the kinds of historical questions that drive the research agendas of contemporary historians; and to the kinds of historical literature historians write, including analytical, narrative, scholarly, popular, and experimental. How do historians find and interpret their sources? How do they engage with existing scholarship while still striving to push their discipline forward? What methods do they apply to communicate the results of their research to other scholars and to a wider public readership? Students will learn to evaluate a wide array of different historical sources (including written documents, material artifacts, oral histories, and visual culture). They will also gain experience in meeting the challenges of writing their own works of historical scholarship, producing an original piece of written history by the end of the semester.	0	0
643	643	HIST-UH	3110	Economic Development and Environmental Change in China	Can China strike a balance between economic development and environmental protection? This question, perhaps the most important question facing China (indeed the world) over the next few decades, pits economy and environment against one another. How did this adversarial relationship come about? Is it necessarily adversarial? Is it rooted in long-term trends in Chinese history, or in the most recent decades of double-digit economic growth? Are there solutions? Or are there better ways of asking the question? This course will look closely at the benefits, the consequences, and the costs of economic growth to society, ecology, and environment in China. The focus in on present dilemmas, examined through an historical perspective.	0	0
644	644	HIST-UH	3112	Asian Borderlands	"How do we study peoples, places, and societies that lie within ""borderlands,"" spaces that either connect or separate larger powers?  This course considers that questions through two examples of borderland regions that lie within and between southeast Asia and China.  The first is a place that appears on no world map by which scholars now call ""Zomia,"" the densely populated upland regions of mainland Southeast Asia and Southwest China.  We will look at different ways studying this ""non-place,"" test the heuristic limits of key analytical categories like nation, state, and citizenship, and explore alternative notions of political and cultural community.  The second borderland region is the South China Sea, which others call the Champa Sea, or the Philippine Sea, or the North Natuna Sea.  It is a place that few people inhabit, but which has been a crucial source of natural resources and mobility for states and peoples claiming ownership or rights to parts of it.  Some fear it may be the flashpoint of a third world war, and how we understand its history may make the difference."	0	0
645	645	HIST-UH	3115	Global Asia	This course focuses on intra-Asian interactions and Asia’s connections to other parts of the world from early history to the contemporary times. It examines how these interactions and connections have shaped Asian societies, facilitated long-distance transmissions of ideas and practices, and influenced modern-day geopolitics. Additionally, the impact of Asia on global economy and the environment will be explored. Readings for the class with include primary sources, including the writings of key Asian intellectuals. Topics such as the transmissions of Buddhism and Islam, the impact of the Mongol Empire, Indian Ocean connections, and intra- and extra-Asian migrations will be analyzed in detail. This course may be taught as a hybrid (online and in “distributed” classroom) course (mixing online and in-class meetings) with faculty and student participants from NYU’s Global Network University.	0	0
646	646	HIST-UH	3310	Humanitarianism in Africa: A Critical History	"This course is a critical exploration of humanitarian intervention projects in Africa from the abolition of the slave trade to #Kony2012. Students will learn about the history of antislavery campaigns, missionary Christianity, colonial development, postcolonial conflict interventions, and contemporary projects about human rights. This course will use recent scholarship to discuss these diverse projects and their historical contexts. Additionally, students will closely read a set of primary sources, memoirs, newspaper articles, and films, which collectively articulate a problematic discourse on the ""salvation of Africa."" Students will subject these different sources to the same questions: what did Africa need to be delivered from? Who were the agents of redemption? What were the effects of the salvation projects? How did Africans react to them? The goal of this course is to deconstruct the prejudices about Africans embedded within salvation projects and to explain how these campaigns have been part of the larger dynamics of power that have defined Africa’s position in the world before, during, and after the European colonization of the continent."	0	0
647	647	HIST-UH	3312	Arts and Politics in Modern Latin America	The course explores the relationship between arts and politics in modern Latin America. It focuses on the role played by the arts in some of the region’s main political processes, such as state formation, revolutions, and modernization. The course traces the intellectual and social repercussions of theater plays, music, literature, and the visual arts in Latin American societies. Specific themes include baroque and neoclassical poetics, nationalism, modernism, race and ethnicity, avant-gardes, memory, and truth.	0	0
648	648	HIST-UH	3315	Love in Africa	This course focuses on love in Africa, from the late 19th Century to the present. By doing so, the course introduces students to a multiplicity of themes in African history, from the history of gender and sexuality to popular culture, generational conflicts, and the AIDS epidemics. Studying love is central to understanding how Africans have imagined and lived their lives as gendered individuals and members of their societies, often in the face of oppressive colonial regimes and strenuous living conditions. The course will view love in its various declensions: as an emotion and expression of intimacy (the notion of romantic love), as virtue (love in theological and political discourses), as a set practices at the chore of conjugality and sexuality, and as an object of debate in the public sphere. Students will learn how to historicize affects and their relationships to society, politics, and economy. We will read fiction and primary sources, watch movies, and discuss recent academic works that will help us understand change and continuities in how individuals and communities across Africa have defined, debated, and experienced love.	0	0
649	649	HIST-UH	3316	African History through Film and Literature	This course introduces students to the major themes of African history through film, literature, and music. Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans’ responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. The broad goal of the course is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.	0	0
650	650	HIST-UH	3317J	A History of Economic Thought from Adam Smith to the Euro-crisis	The expansion of the modern economy over the past 200 years is unprecedented and awesome. Liberals, socialists, Marxists, Keynesians, and supply-siders alike recognized this capacity, and together they overturned the Malthusian propositions of old. We began to think in terms of ‘growth’ rather than ‘wealth,’ and ‘income’ rather than ‘assets.’ They provided the toolkits into which we reach when we redress economic crisis and seek sustained improvement. We thought our way out of crisis after 1945 and 1973, after some spectacular failures in the 1930's. Arguably we are failing again today, with much of the industrialized world hovering between recession and tepid growth. The course proposes that same world of economic thought places limits on our actions, partly because new orthodoxies have made certain options unthinkable, however reasonable they me be; inequality for example is accepted as necessary and even good. We will consider contrasting approaches to the crises of 1929, 1973, and 2008, and end with a case study of the Eurozone, the EU, and the ongoing crisis in Greece. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Greece.	0	0
651	651	HIST-UH	3318	US Foreign Policy since 1898	"This course will explore the central events, issues, and ideas driving US foreign policy throughout the 20th century, starting with the Spanish-American War in 1898 and closing with the “war on terror.” It will analyze the country’s ascent to become both an industrial and political global player by the end of the 19th century, its rise as an economic and financial power during the first half of the 20th century, its global military presence during/after World War II, its cultural diplomacy efforts and ‘grassroots Americanization’ of USA popular culture and lifestyle, as well as its military and political conflicts abroad during and after the Cold War. The course will examine notions of national power, territorial acquisition, modern warfare, racial discrimination, and class and gender hierarchies. It will also discuss the consequences of and resistance to US foreign policy at the receiving end, critically examining concepts such as “American exceptionalism,” “the American Century,” “imperialism,"" the ""free world,"" “grand strategy” and global leadership, among others. For students interested in international relations and foreign policy, as well US history, politics, and culture."	0	0
652	652	HIST-UH	3319	African American Freedom Struggle	"This course explores the African American freedom struggle in the United States. It analyzes its historical origins, African American emancipation during the Civil War and reconstruction, migration patterns and economic conditions in the agricultural and industrial sectors, ""Jim Crow” laws and the “Separate, but equal” doctrine, as well as the impact of US military engagements and the Cold War on race relations during the 20th century.  The course examines the various challenges to legalized segregation in the aftermath of World War II, the powerful grassroots campaigns of African American civil rights activists and organizations during the 1960/70s and their political and cultural impact, and the emergence of black nationalism and black power.  It also traces the ways in which the struggle for racial equality in the US was perceived as part of a larger struggle against colonialism around the world. Furthermore, the course incorporates discussions about affirmative action, the ""prison-industrial complex"", the notion of a “post-racial America” under the Obama administration into the broader context of an ongoing quest for equal rights and social justice in the US.  No prerequisites."	0	0
653	653	HIST-UH	3320	Port Cities of the Atlantic World	This course explores the development of port cities on both sides of the Atlantic as vital nodes of economic and cultural exchange from the early modern period of European colonization to the contemporary era of globalization. Tracing the entangled histories of the Atlantic World, students will explore the emergence of new colonial cities and the transformation of established urban centers as a function of new patterns of commodity circulation, labor migration, and cultural influence. Special attention will be given to changes in the built environment in response to shifting technologies and political contexts and to the spatial, racial and gendered restrictions that characterized these new urban forms. Case studies will be drawn from a wide range of cities, including Rio de Janeiro, Liverpool, Havana, Seville, and Lagos.	0	0
654	654	HIST-UH	3321J	Atlantic Moments in the Making of the American Republic	This course will explore the philosophies, ideas, and practices that went into the making of the American republic.  We will begin with Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Harrington, and Montesquieu and new notions of republicanism, liberalism, and empire.  We will explore the radical currents of the English Revolution that sought to place democracy on the political agenda.  And we will see how these ideas influenced the views of Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, and Paine.  Throughout, we will read selections from original texts.	0	0
655	655	HIST-UH	3322JX	African Empires: West Africa and Ethiopia	Empire is usually associated with developments and formations in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, but Africa also witnessed and participated directly in this form of political experimentation and expansion of cultural and economic influence. This course focuses on imperial formations centered in West Africa and Ethiopia, whose independent histories date back to the beginning of the first millennium CE. The convergences and divergences between the regions as they relate to empire are noteworthy, especially as they relate to religion. Monotheism would prove to be a critical motivating and explanatory factor, expressed through Christianity in Ethiopia, and Islam in West Africa. Islam alleged “clash” with the West has occupied the center of the world stage for decades now.  Both cultural advances and intense conflict have characterized developments in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia, while the question of Islam in Europe has become a major issue for the continent and Great Britain given ongoing demographic changes.  Africa south of the Sahara is no less a part of this unfolding global drama, where both Christianity and Islam has played a seminal role in the continent’s historical development.  There yet exists a great deal of confusion, mystery, and misunderstanding about these religions in Africa, so to engage in simultaneous inquiry into both is not without its challenges. The opportunity to study Christianity in a setting like Ethiopia is a unique, once-in-lifetime opportunity, allowing students to both engage academic discourse while actually observing and experiencing what is being discussed in the classroom.  In the course of our time together, such topics as monotheism and their adaption to Africa, gender relations, connections to slavery and concepts of race, theories of government, social movements, scholarship and education, and systems of trade will all be analyzed.  The historical context provides the window through which these matters will be examined.  The course is designed to facilitate inquiry and provide students with an opportunity to engage secondary scholarship as well as to closely read primary sources (in translation), with a focus on Ethiopia West Africa from the first through the nineteenth centuries. The format consists of morning classes followed by afternoon site visits, and will include traveling to Ethiopia, where daily lectures will establish the context for wide-ranging discussions featuring student participation and exchange.  Site visits will be coordinated with classroom topics to enrich the learning experience.  PLEASE NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.  This course includes a required international trip to Ethiopia.	0	0
656	656	HIST-UH	3323J	Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade: History and Memories	This course is an intensive 3-week J-term course that will give students the opportunity to engage with the economic, social and political history of the slave trade on both sides of the Atlantic.  We will explore the history of the trade through a variety of texts, both primary and secondary, and will travel together to some key sites of the slave trade in Ghana.  The time in Ghana will allow us to develop the basis for a specific and local understanding of the slave trade thus grounding this massive historical event in the particulars of the history of Ghana and the “gold coast.”  We will be primarily concerned with the wide-range of ways that the trade is documented and remembered.  As such, while the course is historical in its subject matter, it is decidedly interdisciplinary in its engagements.  We will consider public histories, acts of memorial and remembering, films, novels, datasets, and economies.  The history of slavery poses a particular set of challenges for historians and for cultural practitioners how do we document and understand an institution whose practices were, at least partially, rooted in the denial that African people had history or historical importance?  The archives of slavery are fundamentally incomplete, with only rare testimony from any of those 12 million people who were captured and sold into Atlantic slavery.  This means that scholars and artists alike have employed a range of disciplinary strategies to grapple with the history and afterlives of slavery.  We will explore a wide range of approaches to the study of slavery over the course of our time together, and will work carefully to identify the disciplinary and evidentiary tools employed by the scholars and writers and artists that we will encounter.	0	0
657	657	HIST-UH	3510X	Muslim Societies in African History	The objective of this course is to trace and understand the history of Islam as a religious tradition and Muslim societies in Africa as part of a larger world. This course surveys the history and historiography of Islam in Africa from its arrival in North Africa in the seventh century through the present day in postcolonial Africa while also paying attention to continuing points of contact and exchange between Muslims in Africa across the Sahara as well as the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Students will examine the history of Islam in Africa in light of issues such as conversion, interactions with other religious traditions, reform movements, slavery and race, education, gender, European colonial rule, and postcolonial politics. Possible sources for the course include Arab geographical and travel accounts, juridical texts debating social categories of race, slavery and gender, regional chronicles reflecting the interface between Islam and local African religious traditions, colonial reports revealing fears of Islam as a unifying force across empires, and audio recordings of religious sermons.	0	0
658	658	HIST-UH	3511X	Islam in the Indian Ocean World	Why do most of the world’s Muslims live in the Indian Ocean world a region often referred to as the ‘cradle of globalization’? How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims’ beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials. Throughout, students also probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam.	0	0
659	659	HIST-UH	3512J	Science and the Sea	This history course is a journey - both a physical one from the UAE to India, and an intellectual one exploring the historical relationship between human interaction with the Arabian Sea and the development of the sciences of astronomy, meteorology, geography, physics, marine biology, botany, pharmacology and medicine.  The course features sailors, fishermen, pearlers, farmers and other ordinary social groups as ‘collective scientists’ who contributed in important ways to both the production and the practice of these sciences.  The course additionally explores the Arabian Sea as an ‘information super-highway’ for the cross-cultural movement and exchange of scientific knowledge, institutions, and practices – considering connections and comparisons between the interior and coastal landscapes of the UAE and Gujarat, in particular.  It concludes by assessing the extent to which Europeans simultaneously became dependent upon, and worked to remake and redefine, both the region’s science and the stories that we tell about its history. Students should expect to do some camping and possibly a short period of sailing during the course.  All students must know how to swim.	0	0
660	660	HIST-UH	3513	Spirituality and Materiality Across the Indian Ocean	The Indian Ocean has provided an important avenue for the movement of people, traditions and ideas over centuries. The course explores the cultural exchange in the Indian Ocean world with the spread of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and later Christianity. How are the different regions of the Indian Ocean littorals tied together through networks of piety, pilgrimage and mythologies?  Do the surviving material remains that dot the littorals - built structures, religious iconography, inscriptions, maps, travelogues, legends and poetry of traveling saints and mythologies about the Oceanic waters itself, attest this dynamic exchange and interconnectedness? How do the circulation of people, relics and mythologies connect the hinterland with people and places across the waters?	0	0
661	661	HIST-UH	3690	Topics in Indian Ocean History	Course topics may include: Southern Africa; trading networks of the Indian Ocean; colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism in the Middle East; the Portuguese seaborne empire; Iran past and present; Southeast Asia; and others.	0	0
662	662	HIST-UH	3710X	Central Asia and the Middle East	This course examines the interconnected histories, cultures, and societies of Central Asia and the Middle East. It will begin with an overview of the Mongol empire and its legacies in Central Asia and the broader Muslim world. The course will compare the emerging post-Mongol Eurasian and Ottoman states through the lenses of law, political legitimacy, succession, and ruling institutions. The course will then compare Russian and Ottoman civilizing missions, imperial nationalisms, treatments of sectarianism and ethnic minorities, constitutionalism, public health policies, responses to Islamic modernism, Marxist and other radical leftist ideas, and women’s emancipation. The course will conclude by considering how post-imperial modernization projects transformed identity, gender, and religion in Central Asia and the Middle East.	0	0
663	663	HIST-UH	3712	Ancient Roman Empire	We will examine the course of Roman history from the earliest beginnings down to the period of the Early Empire, so, about the first-second century AD. Our chief concern, however, will be the project of empire. How and why did the Romans come to possess such a vast empire? How did they perceive their realm? Why were they able to put this thing together? Furthermore, we will have one special concern in all of this. There was one geographical region, which the Romans tried repeatedly to conquer, and to hold. They never succeeded at this. That area is, roughly speaking, the modern Middle East. So, one of our chief questions will revolve around the fact that the Romans were so successful elsewhere, yet, for the most part, failed in their imperial project here. Can this be explained in terms of their imperial project writ large? There is, to my knowledge, no scholarly literature dealing with this question specifically, and as a whole. Therefore, we will get at the matter via a consideration of Roman expansionism, as this played itself out against the background of Roman history altogether.	0	0
664	664	HIST-UH	3713	Russia’s Multiethnic Empire	What was it that kept the Russian empire together for centuries? This course is designed as a survey of Russia’s multiethnic empire from the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan to the early Soviet-era formation of the “affirmative action empire.” Topics to be covered include patterns of imperial expansion, gender and the nature of autocratic authority, religious institutions and practices, colonialism, intellectual debates and key thinkers, serfdom and emancipation, radicalism and the revolutions of 1905 and 1917, early Soviet nationalities policies, the “New Soviet Person,” and revolutionary culture.	0	0
665	665	HIST-UH	3714	Mediterranean: Archives, Translations, Histories	This course approaches the Mediterranean as a multicultural site that lends itself to questions concerning cultural encounters and crossovers, as well as to the issue of historical memory. The Mediterranean emerges in our investigation as the substance of, and the backdrop for, a reevaluation of the various narratives of modernity; for an examination of the centrality of colonialism in that modernization process; and finally, for an encounter with the realities of contemporary immigration. The course brings in methodologies and material from different approaches to the topic, from historical sociology, to philosophy of history, and cultural theory. Key concepts will be defined rigorously: world system, world economy, subaltern, hegemony, archive and translation.	0	0
666	666	HIST-UH	4000	Capstone Seminar	The History Capstone Seminar guides students through the capstone writing process. The course helps students identify the challenges of conducting long-term historical research and writing and develop strategies for meeting those challenges.

The course combines writing workshops and individualized review sessions with structured time for research and writing.	0	0
667	667	HIST-UH	4001	Capstone Project	The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research. In the tutorial, students work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty director to hone their research and produce successive drafts of a senior thesis. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the senior thesis. Students may also elect to participate in a College Capstone Project with students majoring in other disciplines in the arts, and the natural and social sciences. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the Capstone Project, as well as the particular goals of each participant.	0	0
668	668	IM-UH	1010	Introduction to Interactive Media	With the advent of digital computation, humans have found a variety of new tools for self-expression and communication.

Each technology is examined as a tool that can be employed and utilized in a variety of situations and experiences. The World Wide Web will serve as the primary environment for content delivery and user-interaction. Principles of interpersonal communications and media theory are also introduced with an emphasis on storytelling fundamentals, user-centered design, and interactivity.	0	0
670	670	IM-UH	1012	Communication and Technology	From early alphabets to modern virtual reality experiences, this course will explore the development, reaction, and impact of some of humankind’s most transformative innovations - its forms of communication. How have these inventions, such as writing, printing, the telegraph, television, radio, the internet and beyond, influenced human behavior throughout the course of history. How have humans shaped their development and direction? And what role are they playing in shaping our lives both today and tomorrow? Toward the end of the course, students will speculate on the future of communication technologies in a connected world by proposing their own transformative innovation. Readings and discussion will cover communication theory, technical processes, creative applications, and critical investigation. Writing assignments will be paired with practical assignments where students will be challenged to bring their analysis and ideas to life. The web will also be utilized as a test bed for experiencing and experimenting with various forms of communication both old and new.	0	0
671	671	IM-UH	1013	Understanding Interactive Media - Critical Questions & Theories	This seminar course is an introduction to the theories, questions, and conditions that encompass interactive media. Students will engage in readings that critically examine both the impact that interactive media and technology have on culture and societies as well as the ways in which social contexts shape the development and application of these technologies. The contexts become apparent by examining interactive media and interactivity through the lenses of relevant perspectives including politics, ethics, race, gender, and cybernetics. Throughout the semester students will leverage theory to analyze interactive media works and build a vocabulary for making sense of our increasingly mediated world. The course thus serves to lay a conceptual foundation for students to inform and direct their own creative practice. Readings, discussions, research, and writing constitute the body of this course.	0	0
672	672	IM-UH	1110	Circuit Breakers!	Circuit Breakers! is a course designed to introduce students to the world of hardware hacking and circuit bending for artistic and mainly sonic ends. By literally opening up common battery powered objects such as toys and finding their circuit boards, one can change the behavior of the object by interrupting the flow of electricity, creating novel, unexpected, outcomes. This technique has both predictable and unpredictable outcomes, but it is almost always satisfying. In addition to hacking off-the-shelf toys, students will also build their own circuits with a minimum amount of components. Many of the projects in this course center on common integrated circuits, which students will cajole, trick, and abuse in order to create art.	0	0
673	673	IM-UH	1500J	Immersive Storytelling and the Art of Making the Virtual a Reality	An exploration of how immersive technologies (Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality) are transforming storytelling and how it is evolving into a fast paced and disruptive industry. The course uses a mixture of classwork, workshops, field trips and guest lectures from industry leaders and world class storytellers to teach the students new storytelling structures and how these can be used across multiple platforms to create immersive content. Using a combination of project work, mentoring, field trips and collaborative work, the students will learn about the foundations of storytelling, and how this can be translated into cinematic, interactive and web VR, the practical elements of immersive production and the challenges of funding and distributing these projects in a pre-market economy, as well as talking about the opportunities around the corner for immersive storytelling and how the disciplines can apply to various sectors. Students require no prior knowledge of immersive technologies, but will gain more if they have a passion for storytelling and want to position their career within the Creative Industries.	0	0
674	674	IM-UH	1511	Introduction to Digital Humanities	What happens when the arts and humanities are represented in digital form? What kind of new insights can we have when by looking at the data of the humanities? This course will look at intersections between computers and the humanities, a form of inquiry known as “digital humanities.”  The course is structured around a broad examination of concepts important in today’s society (computational thinking, digital identity, text as data, dataset, pattern, algorithm, network, location). Students will discuss these concepts critically, explore real-life examples and put them into practice in hands-on activities. Examples of such hands on work might include, but are not limited to, creating accessible web design, analyzing text digitally, building and visualizing a dataset, curating an open bibliography, thinking about art as data, building a Twitter bot, teaching a computer to recognize human handwriting, visualizing social networks or making digital maps. The course assumes no prior technical skills, but a willingness to explore new technologies is essential for success.	0	0
675	675	IM-UH	1512J	Super-human	We live today at the forefront of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Rapid progress and accessibility of disciplines and technologies such as robotics, sensors, artificial intelligence and machine learning, nanotechnology, rapid prototyping and global communications networks are all building on and amplifying one another, making us superhuman. Smart systems - homes, factories, farms, grids or entire cities - will help tackle problems as diverse as climate change and waste management to human health and happiness. Alongside these technological advances are a set of broader socio economic, geopolitical and demographic disruptions with nearly equivalent impact to the technological factors.  In this course, students will explore fundamental building blocks of technology-enhanced and human-aware rapid product design through a combination of design thinking and design doing. This course makes full use of the liberal arts to connect and constrain in order to challenge students to be creative in both their application of technology and their design of solutions with a real-world impact.	0	0
676	676	IM-UH	1513	Temporary Expert: Developing a Research-based Art Practice	"What does it mean to become a “temporary expert?” How does one develop one’s own creative research-based practice? This course will address these questions by engaging with Abu Dhabi's environmental and social dimensions as a subject for research, context and imaginative art and design opportunities. Students will adopt a wide variety of tools and strategies in order to lay the foundations for a research-based art practice that considers materials, media, context, and audience, as well as one’s personal strengths and desires. Over the course of the semester, students will develop art and design projects that interface with a multiplicity of other disciplines, and engage in idea exchange with experts in the field. Through hands-on practice, case studies, and readings on systems thinking, communication, and the idea of ""the public,"" we will explore method, documentation and presentation of research, as well as the merits of both success and failure."	0	0
677	677	IM-UH	1514J	Resourcefulness: Ethiopia	Innovation in the context of a developing society is not the process of speculation, but the product of resourcefulness and necessity. Communities in the developing world often lack what many take for granted, yet they are surviving and thriving in their own ways - by building schools, supporting entrepreneurship, caring for the environment, turning waste to energy and many other activities. This course aims to help students appreciate and impact these innovations through a combination of case studies, solution design and on-the-ground project fieldwork in Addis Ababa and rural Ethiopia. Students will gain understanding and experience applying ethnographic methods towards the design of innovations in a cultural and economic context through on-location fieldwork. For example, helping local honey entrepreneurs reach larger markets, helping local teachers improve STEAM curriculum, connecting students to the broader NYU Abu Dhabi community of scholars, improving waste management and others. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Ethiopia.	0	0
678	678	IM-UH	2113	Machine Lab	"The saying goes, ""If all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail."" What if all you have is a 3D Printer? In this course, students will be introduced to, and engage critically with, a range of contemporary machines inside and around the Interactive Media Lab. Leveraging historical perspectives, current use-cases, and hands-on making, the course will explore how machines enhance, or limit, our creative processes. Readings and discussion will be paired with practical designing, prototyping, and making of creative computer controlled devices, such as drawing machines, musical instruments, and a collaborative Rube Goldberg contraption. Over the course of the semester, students will be exposed to a variety of tools, materials, and fabrication techniques as well as learn how to use micro-controllers and software to give their machines unique behaviors and abilities. By thinking about machines, using machines, and making machines, the course will offer insight into our creative relationships with our tools."	0	0
679	679	IM-UH	2117	Performing Robots	Intelligent robots living amongst ordinary people used to be a storyline relegated to the world of science-fiction. However, the 21st century has witnessed a rapid adoption of automated machinery in many aspects of daily life. In this course, students will explore the significance of today's robots through the context of art by learning about and building experimental robots for theatrical performance. Robots will be defined broadly, incorporating a wide range of machines both autonomous and remote-controlled. Students will be exposed to critical analysis regarding the historical and contemporary use of machines in art and theatrical performance. In parallel, students will also learn about electronics, programming, robotics and mechanical construction techniques. Over the course of the semester, students will iterate through multiple projects exploring how robots can convey meaning and emotion. The course will culminate with a final public performance by the robots. Experience with physical computing through Introduction to Interactive Media or a course equivalent is highly encouraged.	0	0
680	680	IM-UH	2310	Mashups - Creating with Web APIs	As the World Wide Web continues to grow and pervade our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are accessible to us via public web APIs - Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, these web APIs offer a way to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. How might we use these available resources to create unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own? Taking a hands-on approach, much of class time will be spent creating projects and writing code, primarily JavaScript, for client-side (front-end) web development.	0	0
681	681	IM-UH	2311	Experiential Video Art	Video heralded a mediated form of expression, quickly embraced by artists, journalists, and provocateurs. This course explores alternative methods of working with video signals in the context of performance and installation. Students develop their own work while examining technical, aesthetic, and theoretical concepts embedded in existing pieces, following video art from the late 1960s to contemporary practices. Topics include thinking about scale, projection mapping, using a camera as a sensor, real-time video manipulation, and alternative screens like LEDs. Previous video experience is recommended, though not required.	0	0

684	684	IM-UH	2318	Decoding Nature	How can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software?  How can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? And how can implementing these code-based simulations offer insight and perspective on both environmental and human behaviors. This course attempts to address these questions by focusing on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems using p5.js (a JavaScript library in the spirit of Java's Processing framework). We will explore a variety of forces and behaviors that occur naturally in our physical world. This includes properties of movement, physics, genetics, and neural networks. For each topic, we will write code to simulate those occurrences in a digital environment. The results will usually be visual in nature and manifested in the form of interactive animated coding sketches.	0	0
685	685	IM-UH	2320	Games and Play	Games and play are deeply embedded in human culture. Play suggests a range of human experiences not easily contained by a common form. Games use their playable form to speak to the cultural spaces in which they reside. There is freedom in play. There is structure in games. How do they work together? This course explores how games structure play to serve their purpose, and how play inspires games to push expectations of popular culture. Informed by game studies and theories of play, students will study analog and digital games to consider the technological, spatial, artistic and social structures that shape a play experience. Utilizing web-based technologies and the Unity game engine, students will assume the role of both game designer and developer, experimenting with building game experiences that convey meaning as well as express aspects of humanity beyond contest and conflict. Some programming experience is preferred but not required.	0	0
686	686	IM-UH	2513	Future Punk	The future: let’s patch it together from scraps. Future studies and strategic foresight are methods of guiding businesses and politics. Punk means to take the master’s tools apart, repurpose them to serve our own goals, to outsmart our adversaries, and to prevail. The compound of the words future and punk, just like in cyberpunk or steampunk, indicates that in the case of future punk, future itself would be setting the stage for the narrative, provide the condition against which the human beings in the world of the story would have to struggle: So in the good old punk tradition, we, too, want to take futurism and use it for our own creations. This class introduces speculative fiction and the more scientific forms of speculation as a means to students to envision, draft, and draw and paint their own images and imaginations of alternative worlds. Students will apply the futurist methods to creative projects and in addition, discuss and critique the field.	0	0
687	687	IM-UH	2514E	Bioart Practices	In this course we will take a tour of the materials and techniques utilized by artists in the emerging field of biological art - that is art which uses life itself as a medium. This hybrid art and science class will introduce concepts in genetic engineering, personal genomics, the microbiome, epigenetics, microscopic imaging, tissue culture/bioprinting, biopolitics, and bioethics as sites for artistic exploration. Organized in thematic modules students will learn basic lab techniques while studying the work of artists in this interdisciplinary field. The three core areas are: Input/Output (imaging and printing with biology, tissue culture), identity after the genome (genetics, personal genomics, microbiome, epigenetics, portraiture), and final projects. Weekly readings and written responses will supplement lab activities. The course will culminate in the creation of original biological artworks by each student, which will be exhibited in the Interactive Media Showcase at the end of the semester.	0	0
688	688	IM-UH	2520J	Making Education	"Making Education is a regional seminar course that will focus on education theory, instructional design, creative collaboration, and production of site-specific ""maker"" learning materials. Rooted in the Interactive Media culture of openness, accessibility and making, students will be challenged to thoughtfully navigate the education system in Kathmandu, Nepal and meaningfully effect learning opportunities in collaboration with our local partner organization. Iterative design cycles and project-based work will be paired with semiformal research, theoretical analysis, ethnographic interviews, reflective writing, and project documentation. Students will experience a unique opportunity to apply the processes and principles of the Interactive Media Program onto a real-world use case. Ideally, a combination of making, teaching, and learning will result in insights that are both personally significant, locally relevant, and globally transferable. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Nepal."	0	0
689	689	IM-UH	3112	Network Everything	This course explores the possibilities and challenges of designing alternate physical network interfaces. Through weekly readings, class discussions, and a series of projects, students will create physical objects that talk to each other over distance. Various wireless communication mechanisms such as radio (Bluetooth, Zigbee, WiFi, and raw), infrared, and ultrasonic are used in the context of creating novel “smart” devices. Topics of discussion in this course include networking protocols and network topologies; network time versus physical time; mobile objects; and wireless networks. Opportunities to build collaborative and creative campus-wide networked projects and systems will also be explored.	0	0
690	690	IM-UH	3114	Sensors, Body, & Motion	"Using computer vision, machine learning, gesture recognition, wearable technology, projection mapping, a variety of sensors, and OpenFrameworks (C++), students will create interactive art and performances that leverage the full potential of the human body. Directly injecting ""people-sensing"" into an artwork via these readily accessible open source technologies, generates a unique feedback loop, or dialogue-like relationship, where a person and a computer are continuously reacting to each other's senses. This course will examine this feedback loop, specifically how a person is directly integrated into the artistic expression of the work. Ultimately, students will create interactive installations and performances where the human body is the central component of the artwork."	0	0
691	691	IM-UH	3310	Politics of Code	While our relationships between ourselves, our environment, and other people are inherently political, computer technologies and technology companies consistently claim to remain “neutral”. This course will assume the opposite - software is political - and focus on how software applications share commonalities with political systems, how they affect their users as political actors and how we can build alternatives to those systems. This course is aimed at deconstructing the design and implementation of software as a political medium, such as Facebook’s timeline algorithm, city officials’ use of computer simulations to orchestrate urban life, blockchain-backed proof of ownership and algorithmic criminal assessment. Along with an introduction to political theory and media studies, coupled with an exploration of the underlying political impacts of those systems, students will work on several hands-on projects to offer functioning alternatives to those systems. To that end, this course will include several workshops in JavaScript and Python.	0	0
692	692	IM-UH	3311	Alternate Realities	This course will introduce students to the design and development of Virtual Reality experiences. We will examine these increasingly popular means of delivering content and social interactions and identify their unique affordances over existing platforms. Students will be challenged to harness the specific advantages of VR from conception through functional prototype. The class will also cover case studies of effective use of VR in information delivery, as well as social and artistic experiences.	0	0
693	693	IM-UH	3312	A.rt I.ntel	"Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms affect many aspects of our lives whether we realize it or not: banking transactions, healthcare treatments and diagnoses, entertainment recommendations, smart car functionality, customer service agents, financial trading… the list goes on and on. The power of these algorithms lies in their ability to leverage computers to ""study"" and ""learn"". Instead of programming a computer to do a specific task, we program the computer to train and teach itself how to do any number of tasks. As artists, how can we harness the power of these algorithms and apply them towards creative endeavors? This class will explore that basic question. Through a combination of high level applied machine learning techniques, speculative design of artificial intelligence, and some basic understanding of how these algorithms work at a low level, students will explore this rich new field. With their machine counterparts, they will create images, sounds, text, intuitive interactions, chatbots, and more."	0	0
694	694	IM-UH	4000	Capstone Seminar	The Capstone Seminar course is the first part of a year-long Undergraduate Capstone in Interactive Media. The beginning of the Seminar focuses on reflection and conceptualization, emphasizing the need for a strong thematic approach and foundational inquiry underlying the Capstone Project. Design and ideation exercises will help students frame their multidisciplinary work in terms that are personally relevant as well as accessible to a wider audience. Through additional research, prototyping and iteration, students will work towards creating a production plan for an interactive work to be designed and developed during the Capstone Project course. A collaborative spirit will be infused across the Seminar through constructive input and critical feedback of Capstone peer’s project development along with student-led discussions of texts and works that have helped inform their creative direction. By the end of the course, students will produce a statement of creative intent that will include the research question and relevant conceptual contexts with which they want to engage along with a roadmap outlining the practical steps towards the realization of the Capstone project.	0	0
695	695	IM-UH	4001	Capstone Project	The Capstone Project builds upon the conceptual and iterative design process of the Capstone Seminar and serves as a semester-long production course for Interactive Media majors. Students will leverage the skills they have learned in terms of software, hardware, interaction design, media study, and design thinking to create and innovate on their proposed project. This process will involve rigorous planning, testing, and documenting that follows a trajectory from low-tech prototypes to a finished work that is polished and robust. Students will be expected to share their project with the Interactive Media community as well as offer support to their Capstone peers through involvement in practical user testing and exhibition of each other’s work. Upon completion, students will have demonstrated an ability to build, deliver, and reflect upon an interactive media product or experience that meaningfully addresses a chosen topic of inquiry and pushes the boundaries of the form. Emphasis also lies on professional production practices and presentation through the sharing and re¬examining of the work, be it commercial, social, or artistic in nature.	0	0
696	696	LAW-UH	1010	What is Law? Comparative Global Jurisprudence	"This course poses the fundamental questions:  “What is law?”; “What is a legal system?""; and “What is the rule of law?”  Appreciating that law reflects different cultural and historical facts, the course employs a comparative methodology in order to explore the fundamental questions from the perspective of various legal traditions.   This comparative methodology considers jurisprudence from African, Chinese, Hindu, Marxist, Islamic, Southeast Asian, and Western legal traditions.   In relation to these diverse legal traditions, the course examines the topics of natural law, legal positivism, interpretivism, legal realism, justice, human rights, critical legal studies, feminist jurisprudence, critical race theory, and post-modernist jurisprudence."	0	0
697	697	LAW-UH	1011	Legal Writing and Research	This course provides an introduction to sources of law, legal research, legal reasoning, and interpretative methodologies. The course discusses the sources and techniques for basic legal research. It develops and hones students’ ability to write about complex legal issues in a variety of settings and for a variety of audiences. The course focuses on the interpretation of texts, developing clear and persuasive arguments, and the use of available library resources including technologically available legal materials. It also treats the drafting of legal briefs, memorandum, and other legal documents. A central feature of the course is to lay the groundwork for working with various law-related texts as a foundation for legal studies and for the eventual senior capstone thesis.	0	0
698	698	LAW-UH	1012	Legal System and Method	The history of Western law is that of the two Romes, of the Papacy and law—papatus and imperiatus. It is a narrative of codification and the books of law, of scriptural texts and the casuistry that they generate. The first moment of legal study is that of inaugural texts and collections, of sovereignty, its representation and its textual delegation. The course will introduce the hierarchy of sources of law, the process of enacting law, the concepts of norm and rule, and then the plural regime of legal interpretation of sources, the hermeneutics of practice. Beginning with the concept of the code, the course will proceed to the topics of statutory interpretation, systems of precedent, and forensic rhetoric in distinct substantive legal disciplines. As the English legal sage Sir Edward Coke put it, inevitably in Latin, nemo nascitur artifex—no one is born a lawyer. To this end, the methods course will also entail and be supported by a vigorous legal writing and research program.	0	0
699	699	LAW-UH	1013	Business Law	The law has become a central subject in the world of business, setting the rules and regulations under which economies operate. This course explores the legal environment in which businesses operate and studies the interaction between business and the legal system. The course will first introduce students to the legal and constitutional environment of business and business dispute resolution. Students will then be introduced to intellectual property and internet law, business crime and regulatory compliance, business contracts on a comparative law basis, business negotiable instruments such as checks and banking, letter of credits, documentary credits, debtor-creditor relationships and more specifically creditor’s rights, bankruptcy, reorganization, employment relations, agency, labor and immigration. This course will then examine the business organizations such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies and different topics that dictate how to form, buy, manage, run, close or sell a business.	0	0
700	700	LAW-UH	1014	Commercial Law	This course is designed to provide you with the basic building blocks, the knowledge and skills, to deal confidently with company law. It is an area of law that many students expect to be dry, technical and difficult. It is certainly challenging and as a largely statute-based area of law, potentially dry. But the reality of company law is very different. The course does not slavishly follow the structure of the Companies Act 2006 - the largest piece of legislation ever produced by Parliament. That would be an impossible project and an ineffective way of studying company law.  Focusing upon underlying fundamentals, contemporary debates and transferable skills this module enables you to explore the basic principles and concepts central to company law in their social setting.  The course treats the role of company law in the regulation of business organizations, introduction to legal forms of business organization; incorporation; separation of ownership and control, corporate governance, directors' duties, and remedies.	0	0
701	701	LAW-UH	1110	Contracts	The course in Contracts will provide an international and comparative introduction to the law of volitional obligations. The course will familiarize students with the basic concepts of promise, consideration, offer and acceptance, vitiating factors, terms and conditions, interpretation, performance, breach, and remedies. Comparing the international regulation of sale of goods and the Roman principles underpinning European contract law, the course will then develop the key features of the common law of contract and trace its roots and future in European law.	0	0

703	703	LAW-UH	2010	Legal Institutions	Common law has for the best part of half a century been a part of European Union law and common law has thus, through international and European links, reattached to its historical and linguistic roots in civil law. The study of substantive law begins with the division, inaugurated in classical Rome, between persons, actions and things. Law operates either in personam, or in rem, through the person or the thing. The study of law thus begins with the concept of subjective right and the law of persons, the framework of citizenship and the definition of the Constitution. Public law, the separation of powers, the legal framework of criminal law and other regulatory domains, and particularly the administration of justice, and the professional responsibility of lawyers, fall within this classification. The domain of private law divides into the basic disciplines of Contract, Tort, and Property. The links from these basic divisions to Commercial, Environmental, and Intellectual Property law will be tracked and framed.	0	0
704	704	LAW-UH	2011	Constitutional and Administrative Law	In Law Schools throughout the world ‘constitutional and administrative law’ – also referred to as ‘Public Law’ – is concerned primarily with the legal rules and processes that structure and regulate a country’s government.  In addition, in this course, we pay equal attention to the study of the historical and contemporary social and political facts and values which qualify the function of such rules. Studying the public law together with the key political facts and values that determine its real function is particularly appropriate in the United Kingdom because its constitution, unlike most other countries’, is neither codified in a single, legally binding document nor considered to be supreme law that could override the Parliament’s will. Instead, the UK parliament is considered entirely free to legislate on any subject matter. As a result the sources of the un-codified British constitution range from a plethora of statutes (Acts of Parliament) and common law (judge-made rules) to political habits (‘conventions’) all of which are subject to change.  Part One will focus on constitutional law and its general structure in the UK, and   Part Two will focus on administrative law and judicial review.	0	0
705	705	LAW-UH	2110	Punishment in Politics, Law and Society	This seminar investigates the state’s power to punish. We read foundational works from philosophy, sociology, political science, and law to explore why states punish, how they punish, and whom they punish. The course focuses on the modern American approach to punishment, including its use of mass incarceration and the death penalty. Students will analyze US Supreme Court cases in light of the fundamental purposes of punishment, and compare penal practices around the world. Though subject to change, activities outside the classroom may include attending arraignment court, observing a sentencing hearing, and visiting a correctional facility.	0	0
706	706	LAW-UH	2113J	International Law	“Inter-national” law, which the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham defined as the rules governing sovereign nations, is today more like a curriculum than a single course. Its subject matter is no longer limited to the “foreign relations” of nations. The course addresses not only the norms that govern states in their legal relations with each other, but also legal issues that arise from the relation of the state to non -governmental actors, business enterprises, citizens and other persons with in their territories. The focus is on understanding the basic sources of international law (treaties and customary law) as well as the actors that influence their development, interpretation, and enforcement (especially governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and international courts).	0	0
707	707	LAW-UH	2114	Climate Change Law and Policy	Climate  change will be a foremost theme that will influence financial activities, and policy and legal framework for years to come. In a noticeably short time span, climate change has become a global challenge calling for collective action. Climate change law is emerging as a new legal discipline. Students in this course will explore how climate change law relates to other areas of law and how climate change has elicited rulemaking process at the international, regional, national and local levels. The class will be invited to study the negotiation process, implementation and current status of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. The class will then proceed to evaluate the various legal tools that are available at national and international level to address climate change, including cap-and-trade, carbon taxation, command-and-control regulation, litigation, securities disclosures, and voluntary actions.	0	0
708	708	LAW-UH	2115X	Comparative Legal Systems: United States and United Arab Emirates	The growing trend of globalization in nearly every field of human endeavor demands legal experts to acquire an awareness of legal traditions and systems that operate beyond their borders. This course will invite students to explore various legal systems from a comparative perspective. Primarily this course will focus on essential characteristics of the three major legal systems: Civil, Common, and Islamic (Shari’a). The class will also examine diverse legal systems, inspired by various political, social, and religious doctrines.  This course will pay special attention to legal traditions explicitly functioning in the United States of America and the United Arab Emirates. This class will offer historical and cultural backgrounds related to the development of legal structures and substantive rules in both territories. Students will study existing judicial systems and essential rules dealing with legal education and practice in the United States and the United Arab Emirates.  The  class will benefit from guests' lectures and field trips in order to gain a deeper understanding of the procedural and substantive aspects of law.	0	0
709	709	LAW-UH	2116	International Business Law	Companies of all sizes, and across all sectors, are doing business in various forms beyond their domestic borders. This course is designed to provide the students with theories and comprehensive information on the legal and ethical implications and ramifications of doing business internationally, along with the related cultural, political and economic issues. The course will first introduce the students to the world’s major legal systems; i.e., the Civil and, Common Law systems. Students will be introduced to the methods pertaining to international business such as international commercial transactions, corporate governance, foreign direct investment issues, transfer of technology, intellectual property with the construction of hypothetical examples. The students will then analyze the scope of liability for the conduct of international business under various theories and approaches within these legal systems (foreign corrupt practices, extraterritorial regulation, tortuous liability, corporate social responsibility). The students will also be introduced to the various methods of resolving international business disputes.	0	0
710	710	LAW-UH	2117	International Business	Globalization has affected the way business is conducted. It has also modified and intensified the interaction between government policies and business. In order to evaluate the risk of international business projects and protect the companies against international business uncertainties, knowledge of globalization, cultural and societal environment, trade theory, government in international business, entry modes, economic integration, emerging markets, financial institutions, management strategy, and the legal regimes that shape the trade and investment in Europe, Asia, Middle East, and in North America in areas such as trade of goods, trade in services, intellectual property transfer arrangements, transfer of technology, and foreign direct investment is crucial. The aim of this course is to enable students to better analyze and understand the opportunities and challenges that companies face when expanding their activities internationally.	0	0

712	712	LAW-UH	2120J	Law in Entrepreneurship	This course will provide an introduction to entrepreneurial strategy, focusing on law as a basic framework. Students will gain the fundamental and practical knowledge of legal competitiveness for enterprises, be introduced to a broad range of legal issues encountered by founders and business executives, and develop a set of analytical perspectives for making judgments when such issues arise. Students will act in the roles of key decision-makers or their advisors and solve problems related to the development of the competitive advantage of the enterprise in a given market. While the chief concern of those who create and manage businesses of any kind is often in the mechanics of the business itself, law is an integral part of running the machine that is an enterprise. It is law that sets certain standards for the setting in which a business operates and provides the framework to codify the business’ own standards. Thus, insight into the law becomes a significant tool in the business leader’s repertoire. It allows you to be mindful of the business’ limits and knowledgeable about the manner in which the business can be strengthened.	0	0
713	713	LAW-UH	2121	Renewable Energy Law and Policy	This introductory level course on renewable energy examines the historical and legal origins of energy regulations and emerging policies. The course provides an introduction to the renewable sources and basic terms and concepts, regulatory trends and other emerging issues. The primary focus of the course will be on renewable energy policies and laws of the developing countries. We will spend considerable time with Africa, Small Island States, United Arab Emirates, and examples from other countries. The centerpiece of this course is to focus on a specific renewable energy project (in a developing country) completed with international cooperation and assistance. The course will also focus on global institutions and policymaking, the divide between industrialized countries and developing countries, the nexus between global climate change and renewable energy, sustainable energy sources, and challenges that global policymakers will face in future. The course will look at the wide variety of local and regional laws, regulatory techniques, and policy objects.	0	0
714	714	LAW-UH	2122X	Introduction to Islamic Law	What is Islamic law?  What kinds of sources do we use to access Islamic law, and how has Islamic legal thinking and practice changed historically?  This course introduces students to topics in Islamic law while addressing questions of continuity and change in the Islamic legal tradition from medieval to modern times.  The first part of the course will introduce aspects of substantive Islamic law, including criminal and penal law, family law, and the law of war, through the eyes of a twelfth-century jurist's legal handbook. The second part will explore the diversity of Islamic law across chronological and geographic space, examining topics from classical jurisprudence to Ottoman constitutionalism, the encounter with colonialism and contemporary Islamic states.	0	0
715	715	LAW-UH	2123	Public International Law	This course introduces the principles and rules that govern the relations between States, and their interactions with other international actors on the global stage. It is designed to give students an understanding of the rules governing international relations, their historic development, and their application in the modern world. The course will focus on doctrinal aspects of international law and their critical application, including how politics and power inform the negotiation and enforcement of international agreements. The course will cover a range of topics including: sources of international law, subjects of international law, the use of force in international law, the operation of the United Nations system, settlement of disputes in international law (including the role of the International Court of Justice), international human rights, and international environmental law. It offers a rigorous foundation for further study in this field.	0	0
716	716	LAW-UH	2124	Human Rights Law	This course analyzes the legal foundations, global politics and history of the conception, protection, and violation of human rights law. It presents analytical frameworks, concepts, facts, legal theories, and empirical methods used in the study of the politics of human rights law. It examines how democracy and democratization, international law and institutions, the activities of powerful democracies, and global civil society each influence human rights law around the world. It incorporates perspectives from the disciplines of law, political science, economics, history and sociology.	0	0
717	717	LAW-UH	2125X	Islamic Law and Secular Politics	How have the concepts of religion and politics been understood in Islamic legal traditions? How have those understandings changed in response to colonialism and the emergence of the modern state? What is “secularism” today, and how does it relate to Islamic legal thinking in the contemporary world? This course works from the assumption that these three questions can no longer be separated from one another. We draw from recent work in ethnography that shows the everyday reality of Islamic law, in addition to texts in politics, history, and comparative legal theory. We will interrogate dimensions of secularism, sovereignty, and political authority as they intersect with the daily lives of contemporary Muslims in Malaysia, Egypt, Britain and elsewhere. The course begins with a brief, foundational introduction to Islamic law, then proceeds to study the impact of European colonialism in the Middle East and South Asia, the apostasy case against Nasr Abu Zayd, Imam Khomeini’s fatwas on sex reassignment, and several cases of religious conversion; the course concludes with studies of how Muslims navigate the landscape of legal pluralism in contemporary Europe.	0	0
718	718	LAW-UH	2126X	International Commercial Arbitration: From Ancient Arabia to Contemporary Singapore	Arbitration is one of the oldest and most effective methods of dispute resolution. It has grown in importance significantly over the past few decades, particularly on the international level. This course will cover foundational aspects of international commercial arbitration including the arbitration agreement, the arbitral tribunal, the arbitral procedure, the seat of arbitration, the law applicable to the merits of the dispute, and the arbitral award and its enforcement. Students will also turn their attention to the specificities of arbitration in the Middle East, from its Islamic origins to its current challenges, as well to contemporary arbitration practices in Asia, with a particular focus on Singapore. To complement class time, students may visit one or more arbitral institutions, law firms and companies based in the United Arab Emirates.	0	0
719	719	LAW-UH	2128	Theory of Property Law	This course aims to provide, from a critical perspective, an historical introduction to the various ways of theorizing Property and Property Rights in the West, some analytics about the key concepts of the field (once called Laws of Things), and a survey of contemporary debates about Property. The method of the course is genealogical. After a brief presentation of pre-modern ways of theorizing Property, the course is first devoted to the rise and triumph of Property as a subjective, absolute and exclusive right. Then, it examines various attempts to overcome this conception, mainly social, analytical and realist critiques, to conclude with a view on the current debate in Property Theory.	0	0
720	720	LAW-UH	2129	Mooting	How do people, states, and organizations articulate their rights in diplomacy and dispute settlement? What roles do codified law, precedent, and politics play in the resolution of disputes arising from public, commercial, and civil interactions? How do courts and tribunals shape these practices, and how have they created doctrine on jurisdiction, admissibility, interpretation, responsibility, liability, defenses, and evidence? How do lawyers develop legal strategies when law is emerging, fragmented, and precedents are non-binding? This course guides students to answers to these questions through mooting: researching, writing, and presenting legal arguments for hypothetical cases in standardized competitions. The course first introduces dispute settlement and/or prosecution in the international context; legal research techniques, briefing, and argumentation; and sources relevant for a mooting competition. Students then research, write, and practice legal arguments. Qualified students may form a team to compete in international mooting competitions in Dubai, Washington, The Hague, Nuremburg, Hong Kong, or Vienna.	0	0
721	721	LAW-UH	2500	Criminal Law	How does law concern itself with crime? Indeed, how is crime defined in law and is its conceptualization temporally determined? This course will seek to examine the notion of criminality with reference to the subject of the ‘criminal’ and the juridical apparatus that seeks to punish it. Here, we will look at juridical concepts of criminal responsibility as well as key criminal legal doctrines. We will situate the juridical notions alongside social, political, and historical contexts. For this we will engage with various perspectives on the historical developments of the idea of punishment, and conclude with the contemporary criminological turn to the management of crime through preventative measures, and surveillance technologies.	0	0
722	722	LAW-UH	2501	Torts	The course examines the effectiveness of the tort system in compensating individuals suffering personal injury, injury to reputation, psychological damage, economic loss or incursions on private property as a result of accidents, disease or intentional acts. Focusing on the tort of negligence in particular, the course explores the social, economic and political contexts in which the rules and principles of tort are applied.  The course is divided into three parts.  The first part will explore the historical development of tort, the nature of tort law and the relation between tort and other branches of the law of obligations and tort's relation with other legal systems.  It provides an in-depth exploration of two organizing themes (fault and damage) within tort law drawing upon a range of examples from tort law and from the tort of negligence.  Part two contains the core of the course and is an extensive exploration of the tort of negligence, with special emphasis on an examination of the duty of care concept.  The final part of the course explores some intentional torts, with emphasis on torts aimed at the protection of reputation, confidential information and the quiet enjoyment of land.	0	0
723	723	LAW-UH	3010	Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility	This course examines the ethical issues raised by the function of law and lawyers in protecting individual rights and advancing the common good. The increasing globalization and transnational practice of law warrants a comparative perspective with regard to specific issues in legal ethics. Legal materials are drawn from a variety of jurisdictions, such as Australia, China, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States, in order to elucidate the relevant issues in legal ethics. Among the issues addressed are the legal profession and professional identity, trust, truth telling, confidentiality, conflict, client autonomy, access to legal services, cause lawyering, ethical breaches, and malpractice. These ethical issues in law are considered from a range of philosophical, cultural, social, economic, political, and religious perspectives.	0	0
724	724	LAW-UH	3500	Property - Land Law	This course will give you the opportunity to develop a broad and coherent understanding of the key aspects of land law, and a critical awareness of the significance of contemporary research and debates about the subject. The following topics are covered in the course: (1) Thing or Process including Estates and Interests, Adverse Possession, Equitable Interests, Actual Occupation, Proprietary Estoppel; (2) Qualities of Ownership including Joint Tenancy and Tenancy in Common, Express and Resulting Trusts Acquiring and Quantifying Constructive Trusts; (3) Mortgages; (4) Freehold Covenants; (5) Easements; (6) Prescription; (7) Leases; and (8) Lease/License. This course proffers a coherent understanding of key aspects of land law and a critical awareness of the significance of contemporary research and debates about the subject. It fosters the ability to read, review, consolidate and assess critically cases, statutes and scholarly publications in the field. It exemplifies a practical understanding of how established techniques of research and enquiry are used to create and interpret knowledge in law and some originality in the application of that knowledge to legal problems and debate.	0	0
725	725	LAW-UH	3501	Equity and Trusts	This course is designed as an introduction to the principles, techniques and functions of equity. Disputes which arise in commercial and family contexts are increasingly resolved by recourse to equitable principles. There is therefore a corresponding need to understand the developing law, to analyze critically the functions and approaches of equity and to evaluate its impact. This course provides an elementary treatment of these matters. It concentrates on the social and legal contexts in which equity is  important. Traditional analysis of equity, in terms of its historical development and its maxims, is also a feature of this course.  The course involves examination of equity's central concept, the trust. Its functions range from the preservation of family wealth to its use as a medium for collective investment trusts and superannuation and pension funds. We also consider the private purpose trust and the use of the trust in charitable provision. The course moves on to engage with issues around breach of trust, including the duties of trustees, the remedies obtainable and new frontiers in the law, such as restitution.	0	0
726	726	LAW-UH	3503	European Union Law	The purpose of this course is to equip you with a thorough understanding of the key features of the European Union (EU) and its legal order. Given the significant impact of EU law and policies on the Member States and beyond, understanding this area of law is vital for any legal practitioner. The study of EU law is also extremely rewarding from a more academic perspective, as it teaches us important lessons about the interaction between different legal orders, the limits of State sovereignty and the role of international institutions. In recent years, the EU has become a source of continual political conflict: both over the content of its measures and the legitimacy of its institutions. We will consider these questions throughout the course and in particular in the context of two major crises that the EU is currently facing: the refugee crisis and Brexit. The first part of the course will focus primarily on the institutional and procedural law of the EU, while the second part of the course will be concerned with the rules governing two key substantive policy areas, the internal market and the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ).	0	0
727	727	LAW-UH	4000	Legal Studies Capstone Seminar	In this seminar forum under the guidance of a legal studies faculty member and in the academic community of the seminar participants, students identify a discrete legal text, case, or issue (or several thereof), and then engage in critical analysis from not only legal but also from philosophical, cultural, social, economic, religious, and ethical perspectives.  While identifying the question(s), students undertake requisite research and begin drafting a senior thesis.	0	0
728	728	LAW-UH	4001	Legal Studies Capstone Project	On the basis of the work developed in the Capstone Seminar, students write a senior thesis, a significant paper that is intended as the culmination of the legal studies curriculum.  During the Capstone Project, the student takes fundamental responsibility in meeting the challenge to contribute to knowledge, reframe conventional approaches, and/or create something new.  At the end of the Spring semester, each student will present her/his thesis before a panel of three faculty members.	0	0

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a ""deep dive"" case study of a leading social enterprise, Sekem Group in Egypt, students will explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be ""change makers."""	0	0
730	730	LEAD-UH	2110	United States  in Conflict: Cases from Politics, Economics, Media, Culture, and Law	This course provides students with an understanding of the interconnection between politics, economics, entrepreneurship, media, law, and culture in the United States and with critical tools to interact with and explain the US to others. Students are challenged to think deeply about these fields and their continual impact on entrepreneurship and soft power worldwide. Interaction with and instruction by influential persons in these fields will provide students with an unprecedented opportunity to learn these skills from the people who shape and wield these tools masterfully. By hearing, seeing, and questioning key people in these fields, students will develop their own perspectives on the meaning of entrepreneurship and its role in US society. Students will hone their analytical, communication, and writing skills through written assignments, group work, and rigorous class discussion. Lecturers span a range of executives, entrepreneurs, media titans, and government officials.	0	0

735	735	LITCW-UH	1003	Introduction to Creative Writing	This workshop introduces the basic elements of poetry, fiction, and personal narrative with in-class writing, take-home reading and writing assignments, and substantive discussions of craft. The course is structured as a workshop, which means that students receive feedback from their instructor and their fellow writers in a roundtable setting, and that they should be prepared to offer their classmates responses to their work.	0	0
736	736	LITCW-UH	1100	World Literature	Coined by Goethe and popularized by Marx, the concept of world literature responded to an unprecedented integration of the world’s literary markets, in which Goethe himself felt he could access Chinese, Persian and other literatures in translation. In recent scholarship it has crystallized as a critical approach to the comparative study of literatures from different national traditions. World literature in this more recent formulation refers to the movement of texts across language, time and space. This critical approach draws from related fields such as postcolonial and translation studies. From this critical perspective, we address the questions: Why do some texts, and not others, travel well enough to be read and taught with interest outside of their cultures of origin? Why this beautiful piece of writing, and not that one? Who are the arbiters of international taste? What is lost and gained in translation? The course addresses fundamental practices of interpreting world literature such as how to read across time, across cultures, and in translation.	0	0
737	737	LITCW-UH	1101	Rotten Englishes: Postcolonialism and the Politics of Language	Pidgins, creoles, patois and slang: there are so many Englishes! From Jamaica and Ireland, to America and India, from Spanglish and Hinglish to Londonstani slang and Black English, these languages have been wrought via complex colonial histories and shaped national languages and canons. This course is a broad exploration of writing produced in recent decades by Anglophone writers from the Americas, Africa and South Asia and the theoretical questions raised by such writing. The course will consider fiction and film that ranges from traditionally realist to formally experimentalist, short stories variously characterized as anti-colonial and Afro-pessimist, fiction by new writers and also by Nobel laureates, poetry about immigrant women and also the land-owning elite, and fiction that has been well-canonized as well as important writing that has been more or less forgotten. The course will consider questions of empire, postcoloniality, authenticity, voice and the role of vernacular languages in the writing we characterize as “Anglophone”. Writers to be discussed include Langston Hughes, Salman Rushdie, Shani Mootoo, Arundhati Roy, Zadie Smith, June Jordan, Irvine Welsh, and Junot Diaz. Not available to students who have taken WRIT-AD 149.	0	0
738	738	LITCW-UH	1103J	James Baldwin’s Global Imagination	James Baldwin, one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century, left his family in Harlem for Paris in 1948. It was only his first site of expatriation: moving between Switzerland and Turkey and the south of France, Baldwin called himself a “transatlantic commuter.” This course explores Baldwin’s writing across the genres of essays, fiction, plays, poems, and even children’s literature to consider what his “global imagination” has to teach us about what it meant to live then, and now, as global citizens in an increasingly interconnected world. We will treat New York City as both a literary space explored in Baldwin’s work and a space of our own first-hand inquiry. In addition to visiting Baldwin’s homes in Harlem and Greenwich Village, students will have a special opportunity to spend time researching their final projects in the “James Baldwin Papers” archive at the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for the Study of Black Culture in Harlem. As they work on these projects, students will also have the chance to meet and learn from editors, archivists, scholars, and book designers who produced a recent new edition of Baldwin’s previously out-of-print book, Little Man, Little Man: A Story of Childhood. By the end of this course, students will have a thorough understanding of Baldwin’s significance as a world famous author, a key player in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, and a figure who has greatly impacted the study of race, gender, nation, and masculinity, and continues to shape how we view struggles for liberation and freedom throughout the world in the global twenty-first century.	0	0
739	739	LITCW-UH	1104J	Writing the City	For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in villages. And they’re writing about it. There’s a global renaissance of books about cities, from Madrid to Mumbai and Chicago. In this course, we will look at writers and filmmakers such as Jane Jacobs, Carmen Martin Gaite, García Lorca, Vargas Llosa, Javier Marías, and Pedro Almodóvar to see how best to capture the urban experience. Using a variety of genres, we will examine the impact on global cities of war, gender and social inequality, populism, migration and climate change. We will consider issues of local politics and urban planning as they are reflected in official and unofficial narratives of city life. This course will draw upon the resources of Madrid and include field trips and guided walks highlighting cultural and political developments, including guided visits to the Prado, Reina Sophia, Casa Cervantes, and an outing to a sports event.	0	0
740	740	LITCW-UH	1151	Global Traffic: Fictions & Films of Place and Space	Globalization, the acceleration of transportation and information technologies, transforms the experience of distance, producing perceptions of proximity and inter-connectedness across nations. It foregrounds movement and simultaneity, blurring boundaries between “real” and “virtual” worlds. Through texts emphasizing home, homelessness, migration, diaspora, transnationalism, and tourism, the course examines how literature, film, games, graphic novels, and new media guide readers in this new landscape by charting new concepts of space and place, community, and global citizenship.	0	0
741	741	LITCW-UH	1160	Global Women Writing	What does it mean to be a “woman writer”? This course will explore and examine that phrase, which has for centuries been used as cause for marginalization and silencing. Students will explore what women’s writing from around the world might reveal about the relationships between gender, authority, creativity, power, mobility, and tradition. Do we assume, for instance, the existence of an essential “female” way of writing, shared by women across time and geography? Drawing on both literary and critical materials, students will also consider the complexities and challenges of reading across literary tradition(s) and the ways in which writing from multiple historical and cultural situations represents intersections of gender, race, class, nation, and sexuality. Writers to be considered in this course may include Virginia Woolf, Sor Juana, Mary Wollstonecraft, Lady Murasaki, Toni Morrison, Gloria Anzaldua, and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, among others.	0	0
742	742	LITCW-UH	1501	Feature Writing	This course aims to develop students' skills in feature writing for print and online magazines and trade journals. Emphasis will be placed on all stages of development, from a feature's conception and research to its drafting, revision, and publication. Particular attention will be paid to research and reporting techniques as well as to the demands of writing compelling pieces of varied lengths, from short-form to longer features. The course objective is to prepare students to pitch and publish material written for this course, whether in an NYUAD student publication or other venue.	0	0
743	743	LITCW-UH	1502	Travel Writing	This course exposes students to a range of writing about personal travel and offers students the chance to craft travel narratives of their own of various lengths and formats. The course will focus on such questions as style, method, medium, genre, funding, and strategies or outlets for online and print publication, as well as ethical issues that may arise when writing about countries or cultures not your own.	0	0

745	745	LITCW-UH	1504J	Fiction Writing: Craft Workshop	Where would we be without stories? Better question: Where can we go, and what can we do, as creative writers? Our course begins with the nuts and bolts, learning the tools, acquiring the skills, understanding the architecture of storytelling. Then, together, we build. We’ll also play, debate, and experiment: discovering the line between news articles and fiction; creating characters using social media conventions; writing more vividly by unlocking our senses; declaring our manifestos; understanding publishing; examining censorship; and looking over the edge into the abyss with growing confidence. For writing should never be solitary: we’ll learn from the works of published writers; more importantly, we’ll learn from each other, not just how to write but why we write. And we’ll stride forward with the fictionist’s creativity, the journalist’s rigor, and the critic’s understanding. Fiction, and you, will never be the same.	0	0
746	746	LITCW-UH	1505J	Is it Only Personal: The Role of “The Column” in Public Discourse	Social media has given people an unprecedented forum for expressing opinions about everything from sports to fashion to politics. In the cluttered sphere of public discourse, with increasingly niche audiences, how can we hope to make our voices heard? Is “having an opinion” all we need to build an argument or create a conversation?  In this course, we will consider the shift from personal experience and observation into public discourse, and particularly into the form of “the column”: a short, targeted piece of writing that used to be exclusively the purview of newspapers and magazines and is now the basis of blogs, ‘zines, and even, perhaps, the tweet. Is the personal always the political, as the old saying goes, and if so, how do we articulate that relationship for an audience who may not know or care about who we are?  This workshop-based course will focus on “writing short”: 700-1500 word essays that focus on a range of topics, including cultural happenings, intellectual debates, and current events. We will visit The National, the UAE English-language paper, and students will write an analysis of a columnist of their choice, from anywhere in the world.	0	0
747	747	LITCW-UH	2312X	Masterpieces of Pre-Modern Arabic Literature in Translation	This course explores a selection of canonical and non-canonical works of literature from pre-Islamic Arabia to the so-called 19th-century Arab Renaissance. Through this course students will examine poetic and prosaic texts, while revising their understanding of literary genres and categories, especially in relation to the tradition of Arabic literature. Students will also learn about the major approaches to the study of this literary tradition, while immersing themselves in its rich language, imagery and historical moment. Readings include selections from: pre-Islamic heroic poetry; Umayyad love poetry; Abbasid courtly poetry and its influence on the Andalus; libertine poetry in all its registers from the early Abbasid to the Mamluk period. Prose literature will include the Qur'an; hadith; apocrypha of the prophets; picaresque maqāmāt; The Arabian Nights; and proto-novels from the 19th century.	0	0
748	748	LITCW-UH	2313J	Tales that Travel: Storytelling and Storytellers in Eurasia, 10th-16th centuries	Long before modern media sent stories around the world at lightning speed, good tales traveled. This course explores the travel of tales and considers the ways in which a common culture of story and storytelling can be found throughout pre-modern Europe, Middle East, South and East Asia. Drawing on stories and scholarship from many different traditions, it examines the role of storytelling in human culture, discusses the performance and circulation of stories, and reflects on examples of the types of tales that traveled, including tales of origin, of wisdom (and folly), of trickery (and truthfulness), of success (and failure), of youth and age, of love and the battle of the sexes, and many others.	0	0
749	749	LITCW-UH	2314J	New York Urbanism: Poetry, Art and Architecture Since 1900	This class will study the interactions among 20th and 21st century literature, art and architecture in New York City.  How has New York been imagined, celebrated, critiqued, analyzed by the poets, architects, artists who have lived and worked here since 1900?  What functions has the city taken on for those many cultural producers who have arrived here from across the globe, and across the US?  We will look at case studies of writers, artists and architects coming from China, Mexico, Germany, Italy, England, Holland, Puerto Rico, Missouri, Ohio, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. James, Hughes, O’Hara, Baraka, García Lorca, Mayer, Notley, Torres, Alurista, Matta-Clark, Hammons, Smithson, Koolhaas, Mies van der Rohe, Piano, Ligon, Acconci, Rosler, Zoe Leonard, Renée Green, and Kara Walker will be read in relation to larger literary and political movements including Nuyorican Poetics, the New York School, Language writing, Feminism, the Black Arts Movement, Queer liberation, the Tiananmen Square Protests, Minimalism, Conceptual Art, The Pictures Group. There will be afternoon field trips to the sites discussed in class, and stops for representative New York food.	0	0
750	750	LITCW-UH	2315X	Postcolonial Turn	In postcolonial texts, representation and revolution intersect, as authors, filmmakers, and theorists re-invent literary and cinematic forms and seek to reconceive colonialism, nationalism, and modernity. Through this course, students will compare British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including novels by Conrad, Rushdie, and Salih; films by Pontecorvo and Sembene; and selections from the critical writings of Anderson, Fanon, Said, and Spivak. Students will examine contradictions between Enlightenment concepts of reason, universal freedom, and rights, which established a common humanity of mankind while simultaneously justifying European sovereignty over non-Western peoples. The course examines how tradition and modernity; savagery and civilization; religiosity and secularism; self and other; subjectivity and collectivity; and violence and non-violence played a role in empire and decolonization while challenging received understandings of universalism. Finally, students examine how postcolonial studies is being re-shaped and in turn re-shaping understandings of the “Arab Spring” and the Anthropocene.	0	0
751	751	LITCW-UH	2320	Reading Dramatic Literature: Authority and Imagination	(Formerly LITCW-AD 144)Dramatic literature from the Greeks to the present, including work from Asia, India, and Africa. Students will consider, particularly, work that because of its metaphorical sweep and formal possibilities has been performed over and over again. The course will examine the genesis of these texts and their place(s) in theatre history; students will concentrate on where dramaturgical authority is located and what makes these texts particularly ripe for staging contemporary audiences. The course will focus on tropes, plot construction, catharsis and identification, and other elements that can be linked to text (without losing the fact that theatre is primarily an exchange between the audience and the stage).	0	0
752	752	LITCW-UH	2330	Modern Epic: Tolstoy, Joyce, and García Márquez	This course will examine three “encyclopedic” texts (War and Peace, Ulysses, and One Hundred Years of Solitude) that rehearse and interrogate inherited paradigms of cultural identity, purpose, and destiny. Through sustained attention to formal and ideological tenets of these specific texts, the students will also seek to interrogate some of the salient procedures of realism, modernism, and postcolonialism.	0	0
753	753	LITCW-UH	2340	Inventions of Love: East and West	From the early Islamic poetry of Majnūn Layla to the modern poetry of Mahmoud Darwish, poets and writers in Arabic have long attempted to address the mysterious forces involved in creative expression.  What did writers imagine was the origin of poetic inspiration? How did love (earthly or divine) figure in the poetic personae and works of writers? How was poetic creation different from other states such as madness or prophecy? How did medical, philosophical, legal and ethical discourses frame the questions of poetry and madness?  Is the representation of poetic madness and inspiration in Arabo-Islamic discourse similar or different from other traditions? This course will explore these themes (and others) in great detail through the intensive study of early Islamic poetry, Sufi mystics, maqāmāt, The Arabian Nights, and Persian romances, as well as numerous philosophical, ethical, and medical treatises. Students will also be invited to draw comparisons with similar themes in other traditions of South Asia, East Asia, and Western Europe.	0	0
754	754	LITCW-UH	2361	Travel, Geography, and Imagination in Arabic and Islamicate Literatures	This course considers travel and geography as a theme in pre-modern Arabic and Islamicate literary cultures from the 7th century to the 19th century. During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers’ accounts, geographical works and Sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.	0	0
755	755	LITCW-UH	2503	Advanced Creative Writing: Nonfiction Essay	"""The personal is political"": Popularized by feminist activists in the 1970s, this phrase suggested that mundane experience -- domestic work, reproduction, childcare, as well as gendered education and socialization processes -- were deeply implicated in larger systems of political power. Narrating those experiences, calling them into question, was a political act that stood to reorder society. In the decades since, the notion has become commonplace. But how do writers -- of any gender or other identity category -- most effectively discuss and describe the political implications of their subjective experiences? What forms and platforms are most appropriate, and for which audiences or ends? In this workshop, students read a range of classic and recent works of personal writing (Woolf, Orwell, Baldwin, Adichie, Coates, and others) and develop their own voices as they grapple with the politics of individual experience. Group discussions and peer workshops will be supplemented by individual conferences with the professor."	0	0
756	756	LITCW-UH	2510	Intermediate Creative Writing: Narrative Prose - Form and Style	Every serious writer at some point asks: What is form? What is style? And how do I form my own style? In this course we will write our way towards answering each of those questions. Part laboratory, workshop, playground, and bootcamp, we’ll examine exemplars from modern literature, but more importantly we’ll write a lot: short pieces of narrative prose (micro stories, under 200 words), allowing for more focused experimentation, discussion, and revision towards acquisition of vital skills such as crafting the perfect sentence, writing humor, choosing the right perspective, knowing what to edit and when to cut, and understanding literary mechanisms in order to sharpen your techniques in wielding them. Because writers should be limited only by attempting the impossible, never by the bluntness of our tools. This course will prepare you for advanced creative writing electives, and the capstone, by helping you speak more clearly on the page. For style, according to the novelist Ali Smith, “is what happens when voice and form meet and fuse into something more than both.” Through the alchemy of creative writing we’ll find out what that something is.	0	0
757	757	LITCW-UH	3000	Problems and Methods of Literary Studies	This course is an introduction to questions that are central to both literary scholarship and creative writing. The course will foster an understanding not only of theoretical and methodological concepts, but also an understanding of practice and poetics. Through a range of readings and a variety of assignments, both analytical and practical, students will tackle issues of language, translation, interpretation, structure, and technique from methodological and practical perspectives. This course will prepare students for their capstone project and it is strongly suggested, although not required, that students take the course in their junior year.	0	0
758	758	LITCW-UH	3311	History and Theory of the Novel	An introduction to the history of the novel in a comparative context, as well as its development in European, colonial and indigenous forms. Special emphasis is placed on contemporary critical theory (including circulation studies, aesthetics, deconstruction, new historicism, Marxist approaches, postcolonialism and psychoanalysis). Theoretical readings include works by Bakhtin, Barthes, Lukacs, McKeon, Moretti, Schwarz, and Watt, among others.  Prerequisite: one major required course or permission of the instructor.	0	0
759	759	LITCW-UH	3312	Global Text: Moby-Dick	Is there such a thing as global cultural heritage? This course resituates Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick often described as “The Great American Novel” as a global text that is “worldly” in its outlook and its legacy. The course examines the novel's relation to Christian, Muslim, and Zoroastrian religious traditions; to Greco-Roman tragedy and epic; to Shakespeare; to Western and Eastern philosophical traditions; and to a variety of European, British, and American Romantic traditions. It also examines the novel's engagement with the visual arts. The course poses three sets of questions: 1) In what ways was Moby-Dick a “global” text in its own day, adopting a “worldly” approach that transcends its particular local milieu? 2) How has the history of the publication, criticism, and teaching of the novel transformed it into a global cultural work? 3) What is the cultural legacy of the book today throughout a variety of global media forms, including plays, films, novels, operas, and works of visual art?	0	0
760	760	LITCW-UH	3313	Global Text: Ulysses	Is there such a thing as global cultural heritage? This course presents a case study that resituates James Joyce’s monumental novel Ulysses a book that describes a single day in a single city and is steeped in naturalistic historical detail as a global text that is “worldly” in its outlook and its self-conscious positioning within Western literary history. The course contextualizes the novel within Joyce’s oeuvre through readings of Dubliners, Stephen Hero, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and selections from Finnegans Wake and within the histories of epic and Anglophone modernism. The course brings a number of scholarly methodologies to bear on Joyce’s work including close reading, deconstruction, distant reading, gender studies, literary history, new historicism, postcolonialism, psychoanalysis, and reader response.	0	0
761	761	LITCW-UH	3315	Early Modern English Drama: Staging the World	Doomed lovers, military conquest, imported luxury goods, political treachery, religious conversion, spectacular bodies and pirates. These are some of the plot elements that figured stereotypes and represented transnational movement of people, objects, and stories around the globe in English Renaissance drama. This course will read English plays preoccupied with staging otherness  from the 1580s to the 1640s in genres from city comedy to revenge tragedy to ask how these imaginative constructions draw upon the world to consider what it meant to be “English.” The course will examine the intersection of identity and nation as these ideas are insisted upon  and fractured in the popular imagination of the theater. Questions will be asked: how is the self constructed in relation to the world? Which figures of the “Other” become particularly important to notions of English identity? How is the English body imagined, and what happens to English bodies when they venture elsewhere?	0	0
762	762	LITCW-UH	3316	European Literary Traditions	(Formerly LITCW-AD 3316)A comparative approach to the formation and development of traditions in post-Enlightenment Europe (including Great Britain and Russia), with a particular emphasis on fiction and poetry as embodiments of modernity.	0	0
763	763	LITCW-UH	3317	Migrant Poetics, Narratives of Flight	For the poet Aimé Cesaire, from the tiny island of Martinique, there was the master narrative of the middle passage, that brought African slaves to the Americas; there was the movement of labor and capital that circled the Caribbean in slavery’s aftermath; and there was the circulation  of ideas that produced the radical collages of surrealism. This course examines a range of narratives of flight - that of the refugee, the immigrant, the exile, the migrant worker - in fiction, poetry, film, theater, painting and music. It also examines critical theories of migration on refugeeism, displacement, and immigration, in order to ask: How does “flight” produce new aesthetic forms? How have scholars theorized the range of concepts and problems engendered by such movement? Along the way, we will read about Iraqi refugees fleeing their home, Vietnamese “boat people” migrating to America, Indian painters relocated to France, the Jewish dispossessed of World War II, the movement of workers from Gulf to Gulf, Kashmiri, and Taiwanese, and Russian, poets who long for home. Towards the end of the term, we use this theoretical vocabulary to consider the ocean still to cross (une mer encore à traverser) in relation to two contemporary crises: flight across the Mediterranean and the refugeed Rohingya of Myanmar.	0	0
764	764	LITCW-UH	3318	Arts of Attention: Reading Global Modernisms	"How do works of literature capture, hold, and train our attention? We live in a time when attention and attention disorders have captured both the scientific and the popular imagination. Turning their ""attention to attention,"" like never before, scientists are identifying the rich variety of attentional modes our brain is capable of, as well as a contemporary addiction to, ""narrow-focus attention."" This course plumbs the rich offerings of literature describing a wide spectrum of attentional modes, as well as training, enriching and potentially even healing its reader’s attention. Indeed, long before modern science, modernist literature excelled at both describing human attention and complexly engaging it through its novel experiments. Modernism has long been seen as a Western European interwar phenomenon, with current scholarship vigorously expanding our understanding of these limits. This course will include close examinations of some of the best-known Western European classics, but will also explore some of the long-overlooked origins, expressions, and subsequent migrations of modernism elsewhere, from Europe’s Eastern margins, to the Harlem Renaissance and modern Chinese literature. Primary works by Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, Zora Neal Hurston, Franz Kafka, Boris Pasternak, Lu Xun, and others. Critical, theoretical, and historical readings range from new criticism, reader response theory, structuralism, post-structuralism, to cognitive literary studies."	0	0
765	765	LITCW-UH	3350X	Literatures of the Middle East and the Maghreb	Western media tends to produce a one-dimensional view of Middle Eastern cultures. The reality of the people is often very different. How do Middle Eastern writers represent themselves and their societies in fiction? How have they reacted to the dramatic changes in the Middle East from the early twentieth century on? In this course, students will consider the continuities and diversities of North African and Middle Eastern cultures by analyzing modern and contemporary novels and poetry, as well as films, from or about Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine. The following issues will be tackled: how do novelists translate the changes of their cultures into literary form? What literary traditions do they draw on? How do these reflect the different movements in Islam, and the other religions of the region? What kinds of worldly and personal representations emerge? How have these been changing recently, notably since the Arab Revolutions? How different are novels written in English or French for a global audience from those written in Arabic? What are the effects of reading them in translation? Do the conventions of Western literary criticism work for all literatures?	0	0
766	766	LITCW-UH	3360	Postcolonial Studies	What does it mean to be “postcolonial”? How can we understand the origins of the mixture of cultures and peoples that seems to define our “globalized” age?  And what are the effects, cultural and political, of living under colonial rule? The rise in interest in the postcolonial condition has been marked by a body of work that engages questions relating to empire and decolonization and creates new models for the analyses of power, identity, gender, resistance, nation and Diaspora. In this class, we will examine fiction, poetry, film, and political writings from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and their diasporic communities. Theoretical readings draw from Edward Said, Frantz Fanon, M. K. Gandhi, and Ngugi wa Thiong’o, while fictional and cinematic texts will include work by V. S. Naipaul, Bapsi Sidwha, Jamaica Kincaid, and others. Our aim will be to understand both the ways in which these texts provide new models of analysis and the way they have changed the traditional study of literature in the academy.	0	0
767	767	LITCW-UH	3361	Freedom and Alienation	From the mid-20th century onward, freedom was the original cry in the rapidly decolonizing world. This course considers the various registers of postcolonial freedom and the aesthetic forms they take, from the Caribbean surrealists, agitating against French colonialism, and articulating an aesthetics of negritude, to expatriate South Asian artists in Paris, who find new forms of freedom in abstractionist painting. The Dalit Panthers, modeled on the Black Panthers of America, articulated an anti-caste radicalism in the context of newly liberated India, while African writers from Nigeria to Kenya wrestled with the alienating English of the British empire, and the new languages of Independence. This course uses the dialectic of alienation and freedom, of anguish and exaltation, to think through the range of aesthetic forms that freedom takes: political, social, existential, while also interrogating the nature of caste, race, and gender-based forms of alienation. In doing so, we read some of the key figures that have shaped postcolonial modernities: Albert Camus and Franz Fanon, Simone de Beauvoir and B.R. Ambedkar, Aime Cesaire and Derek Walcott.	0	0
768	768	LITCW-UH	3501	Advanced Creative Writing: Documentary Forms	This course centers on the generative intersection of art and non-fiction: in other words, documentary forms. Documentaries are compelling because they are driven by a desire to investigate, educate, reveal. They often do this by claiming objectivity and reality rather than claiming subjectivity and fiction. During the semester students will therefore explore the relationship between aesthetics, ethics, and point of view in three mediums: poetry, film/video, and visual art, with an emphasis on poetry and text that pushes the boundaries of conventional prose and journalism.	0	0
769	769	LITCW-UH	3502	Advanced Creative Writing: A Novel in Fourteen Weeks	An advanced fiction workshop that offers students the opportunity to hone their writing through peer critique and in-depth craft discussions. Extensive outside reading deepens students’ understanding of fiction and broadens their knowledge of the evolution of literary forms and techniques. The thematic focus of these courses will vary depending on the instructor. There may be multiple sections of this course running in the same semester, each of which may have a different topic.	0	0
770	770	LITCW-UH	3504	Advanced Creative Writing: Workshop in Poetry	This course focuses on writing poetry by experimenting with a variety of poetic forms and writing prompts, including 20th-century and contemporary poetry and statements and essays written by poets. Students will write poetry as well as learn terms for critical analysis. Some of the threads of inquiry and inspiration that will run through the workshop include: What is poetry? What does it do? What is the state of poetry now? What does it mean to write and read poems in English if it is not your home or only language? In addition to workshopping peers’ poetry, participants will learn about the chapbook tradition, make their own small books of between 15 and 25 pages, and organize readings to experiment with various performance-based approaches to poetry.	0	0
771	771	LITCW-UH	3505	Dramatizing History	How does the dramatist bring alive an historical epoch to enliven a work for stage, film or television?  What elements are essential to create a compelling narrative?  Should the characters be actual people or fictionalized composites?  And what ethical issues are raised in such decision-making?  In this arts workshop students will embark on a journey to bring alive stories that hold personal significance.  Whether the tales are connected to family, culture, gender or ‘race’ memory, there are certain steps that may enhance the creation and development of dramatic work based on historical information.  Students will detail their personal process in both creative and critical terms.	0	0
772	772	LITCW-UH	3507	ACW: Workshop in Fiction	In advanced fiction workshop students will write fiction “flash fiction,” short stories, and works that may be extended into the territory of the novella considering things like point of view, dialogue, structure and plot, narrative voice, scene and character building. The class will explore prose fiction that is rooted firmly in reality writing stories seemingly “ripped from the headlines” as well as works that draw on a writer’s imagination, as well as traditions of surrealism. Students will practice writing new works from a variety of prompts, will critique others productively, and revise their works toward a final portfolio of works brought to high polish. Exemplary and representative works of contemporary fiction will be read as starting points for writing exercises, discussions of writing strategies, and toward the development of new works.	0	0
773	773	LITCW-UH	4000	Capstone Seminar	The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice or engage in an extended creative project. The program consists of a two-part capstone seminar and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. (Students receive credit for the seminar in the fall and for the project in the spring.) During the fall semester, students define their projects, develop a bibliography, read broadly in their chosen topic, begin their research, and draft a substantial portion of the project.	0	0
774	774	LITCW-UH	4001	Capstone Project	In the spring semester, students continue to work one-on-one with their capstone advisor(s) and to attend the capstone seminar. During the first seven weeks of the term, students develop a full draft of their project, which may include revision and re-articulation of key theoretical and/or aesthetic choices. Students work with their capstone advisor(s) to produce successive drafts of the project. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the capstone project and the defense of the project before a panel of faculty reviewers.	0	0

Readings range from medieval Arabic culinary manuals and classics of cultural anthropology to contemporary food reporting and literature, with an emphasis on the Middle East.	0	0
809	809	MCC-UH	1003J	Communicating in the Anthropocene	This course analyzes coverage of nature of disasters in the mass media. We will look at disasters through human history and how technology has determined the way the world got to know about them. While earthquakes and floods are ‘natural’, disasters are human-induced. The media should make this distinction, and function as an early warning system. We will look at how nature has been depicted in the media. How can the media address silent, slow-moving emergencies like the global climate crisis? How can attention span of the media and the lifespans of stories be extended in covering nature? What can be the role of communication in inducing rapid, inter-generational human behavior change to address threats to the biosphere during the anthropocene? There will be a field visit to Nepal to observe the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake as well as to meet researchers investigating the impact of the climate crisis on the Himalayas and countries downstream. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students and includes a required trip to Nepal.	0	0
810	810	MCC-UH	1005	Media: Objects, History, Theory	Media are everywhere -- from optic fibers underground, and devices like smartphones and touchpads, to apps such as Snapchat and Yik-Yak. As technologies keep changing, so too do media theories, although much of the old media doesn't go away. We have newspapers, radio, and television, but have we theorized them adequately in their new incarnations? This course links the global history of media technology with the history of ideas, and in doing so to relate theory to media objects in ways that will empower students and clarify how we understand our media environment. Drawing on materials from film and television to political history, the course examines the emergence and spread both of media and of “media theory,” in close connection with and occasional divergence from each other. Surveying select case studies from across the globe, students will seek to establish historical and theoretical frameworks for understanding media's global impact.	0	0
811	811	MCC-UH	1006J	Reporting Morocco	What are the ethics of reporting revolution and its aftermath? What critical frameworks shape our understanding of roles played by media and social media in the unfolding of such events? This workshop in foreign reporting takes as a central case study the state of the media in Morocco and the broader region following the Arab Spring. During the two first weeks of the course, students will learn techniques of feature writing and journalism ethics. Assignments include all sorts of long form readings on the Middle East and more specifically on Morocco, from foreign correspondents and Moroccan acclaimed writers and thinker s (Laila Lalami, Hisham Aidi, Rania Abouzeid, and others) as well as daily news reading on Morocco. A couple of foreign correspondents will video conference with the class to talk about their experience covering the region. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Morocco.	0	0
812	812	MCC-UH	1009J	Reporting Sydney	How does a writer from abroad, a stranger in a strange land, get to know an unfamiliar city or country? Is it possible to write fairly about an unfamiliar culture? Is it possible to avoid the pitfalls of “parachute” journalism and take the time to know a culture from within? What does it mean to be an outsider? A tourist? A journalist? What are the special challenges of reporting in an unfamiliar context? What are the special rewards? And how does travel in a new world change the traveler? In this course you will engage with these, and related, questions through a variety of lenses, reading some of the best travel writing of the past and present and writing several pieces of your own. This is a course in reading and writing nonfiction—and a course in thinking about culture, in all its many meanings. Our culture, the culture we live in—and perhaps our particular subculture—informs our experience of other cultures and the world. You will experiment with various forms of journalistic and essay writing, engaging with Sydney and yourselves.	0	0
813	813	MCC-UH	1011J	Memory and Visual Culture	The last several decades have witnessed a “memory boom” throughout much of the world, most visibly through the building of numerous memorials and memory museums, as well as high-profile debates about memory. This course examines the intersections of visual culture, commemoration, nationalism, and social movements with the politics of memory in the global context. We will study the contestations over memorialization and artistic engagements with the memory of traumatic events, with a particular focus on the politics of memory in Argentina regarding state terrorism from 1976-1983. The course will put memory projects in Argentina into comparative dialogue with examples of memorialization in other contexts such as 9/11 in the United States, the Holocaust in Germany, and state terrorism in Chile, Peru, and throughout Latin America. Through explorations of how art, photography, digital media, and design have shaped cultural memory in these contexts, we will investigate the aesthetics of memory, the role of pedagogy in memorial museums, the spatialization of memory, the digitalization of memory, the role of human rights, and the deployment of memory into political action.	0	0
814	814	MCC-UH	1012J	Mining the Archive in the UAE	Accurate accounts of the past are made possible in large part due to the existence of primary documents deposited in public and private archives. In this class we will explore the vast array of materials housed in a range of public repositories and how they help illuminate the history of the UAE. Students will review primary material to consider how archives are used by documentary filmmakers, historians and other scholars and their role in shaping history and the identity of the UAE. We will visit a variety of sites, including the UAE National Archives and Qasr Al Hosn in Abu Dhabi, and the Peace Memorial Museum, National Film Library and Archive and the National Archive in Zanzibar. Students will also be introduced to the growing number of online databases and consider the future of history given the challenge of preserving information in the Digital Age. Each student will embark on a preliminary archival research project that delves into an under-explored aspect of UAE history. The class will culminate in a class presentation on a research project on a UAE figure. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Zanzibar.	0	0
815	815	MUSIC-UH	1001	Music Theory & Analysis I	This course provides an intensive introduction to music theory: the study of common elements and organizing principles in music, supported by analysis of specific musical examples. This includes constructs that are utilized every day by practicing musicians: intervals, keys, scales, modes, chord progressions, rhythms, meters, and forms, among others. Aural skills and fluency with musical notation are developed throughout the course. Modal practices are examined through diverse traditions including the Arab Maqam system, modal jazz/pop/rock, and choral music of the European Renaissance, leading to a detailed study of melody, harmony, and counterpoint in diatonic tonal music. The repertoire is drawn from both “classical” (Common Practice Period) music and more recent examples of tonality, including popular music. Regular projects in directed composition and analysis provide hands-on engagement with theoretical concepts, while frequent reading and listening assignments place techniques in historical context, introducing significant composers and performers. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship: listening, sight-singing, dictation, and basic keyboard skills.	0	0
816	816	MUSIC-UH	1002	Music Technology Fundamentals	This course is designed for anyone interested in producing music on computer using virtual instruments, samples and microphones. Regardless of style, this course provides an overview of the wide range of tools available to the modern music production. This is an “all-in-one” course for (almost) everything related to music technology, the basics of digital audio, physic of sound, music recording, binaural audio, musical acoustics, signal flow, sound synthesis, music production, game audio, post- production and mixing. Students will also study the elements of production design, composition, song form, and how to arrange, edit, build and shape a song using different D.A.Ws. In this course students will also learn the fundamentals of digital audio, studio and location recording, mixing, MIDI sequencing using Logic Pro X, Pro Tools 12, Ableton Live, music production, and audio programming using Max.

817	817	MUSIC-UH	1003	Making Music	This course will introduce students to a foundational level of knowledge of music composition by producing work across a wide variety of different genres, styles, media and aesthetic traditions. Departing from an approach that looks at different musical systems, the course will guide students through different ways of organizing musical discourse. The emphasis will be on the practical creation of music using different approaches including improvisation and electronics, besides the more traditional paper composition. Students will be actively encouraged to perform their work, and to present other performances, including planned and free improvisation, approaches to the interpretation of contemporary music, installation work, graphic scores and other non-standard notations, as appropriate.	0	0
818	818	MUSIC-UH	1004	Music: Histories and Historiography 1	This course introduces students to readings and lectures on current topics in the fields of music studies and musicology with a focus on historiography, which is the study of the way history has been written. Within this broad framework, the course will engage with the study of music and its history under a number of different guises, including the historical study of music, addressing both research methodologies as well as the historical narratives used to tell the different “stories” about music history.  While the course is organized thematically - providing an examination of music at its intersection with issues related to gender and sexuality, social justice and conflict, race, popular music, as well as media and technology - it is structured historically, providing a forum for an examination of music and musical practices across a wide range of historical and cultural situations from ancient times to the present. Engaging with diverse readings, this course provides a broad critical framework for the exploration of the field of music studies as a discipline that integrates the central concerns of different approaches to musicological and historical research.	0	0

Exploring the myths, legends, and ancient histories that shaped the stories and plots of early operas, the seminar also engages with histories and philosophies of modernity to examine works shaped by the cataclysmic events of the 20th century. Radical changes in the historical conditions of death have resonated far beyond the battlefield, shaping fundamental questions about the meaning of the self, time, and history. How has opera registered these changes and participated in these shifts? Can musical work like an opera provide a map for examining uncharted places beyond the thresholds of human experience? Can opera’s music, language and images address the historical challenges of representing death on stage? Drawing on scholarship from diverse fields, the seminar examines operatic works from the 17th century to the present with a special focus on the arias and songs of this genre’s dying protagonists.	0	0

871	871	MUSST-UH	1101J	Past and Future of Egyptological Collections: The Shaping of Identity	Museum collections are often perceived as static entities hidden away in storerooms or trapped behind showcases. By focusing on the dynamic histories of museum collections, new research reveals their pivotal role in shaping a wide range of social relations. Over time and across space the interactions between these artefacts and the people and institutions who made, traded, collected and exhibited them have generated complex networks of material and social agency. This class will draw on a broad range of source materials to explore the cross-cultural interactions which have created Egyptological museum collections in several locations, including Turin, Italy. These case studies contribute significantly to the development of new theoretical frameworks to examine broader questions of materiality, agency and identity in the past and present.

874	874	PEACE-UH	1110	Transitional Justice	How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.	0	0
875	875	PEACE-UH	1111	International Organizations and Global Governance	The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today’s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations’ origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today’s international system.	0	0
876	876	PEACE-UH	1112J	Truth, Reconciliation and Justice in Post-Conflict Situations	The focus will primarily be on the experience of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, why and how it came into being, how it was structured, how it functioned and its impact on the nation and national development. Sub-themes will include an analysis of four kinds of truth, the problem of denialism, and the difference and relation between restorative and punitive justice. The course will offer comparative reflections on how similar issues have been dealt with in Northern Ireland, Colombia and Sri Lanka.	0	0
877	877	PEACE-UH	1113	Peacebuilding	This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peace building has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing “best practices” approach to peace building and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peace building and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world’s most challenging regions.	0	0
878	878	PEACE-UH	1114	Causes and Prevention of Violence	This course will study violence as a problem in public health and preventive medicine—indeed, the most important problem, since it could potentially, in this age of nuclear weapons, cause the self-extinction of the human species. To do so, students will review writings that illuminate and illustrate the causes and prevention of violence, including wars and civil wars, inter-ethnic violence, revolutions, genocide, terrorism and structural violence. Students will study how the moral emotions, shame and guilt, can motivate as well as inhibit both group and individual violence. Students will also examine cognitive causes of violence, including the backlash, in the form of “political religions”—Nationalism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism, and most recently, Apocalyptic Fundamentalism — against the modern scientific world-view and its challenge to the credibility of the traditional sources of moral and political authority. Readings in this course will include the Bible and works by Thucydides, Shakespeare, Buchner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, Adorno, Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt.	0	0
879	879	PEACE-UH	1115J	Arts for Transformation: The Case of Cambodia	In this course you will look into the power of arts and culture as a transformative force. How can safeguarding heritage, curating history, stimulating contemporary expressions, and promoting sustainability and cultural diversity heal a population and rebuild a post-conflict country whilst being a vital actor in sustainable development? What methods are viable, what tools proved useful, what approaches failed? This course will provide a platform to explore and debate this specific approach to reconstruction, revitalization, reconciliation and peacebuilding.  After gaining independence in 1953, the country experienced a formative period of monarchy, a coup d’etat and heavy American bombing before Cambodia’s dark era began in 1975. For almost four years the Khmer Rouge imposed their radical agro-communist ideology on the people, leaving two million people dead and many starved and overworked. In 1979, the Khmer Rouge regime was defeated by Vietnamese forces and a new government was installed, some of whose members were former Khmer Rouge cadres.  The case of Cambodia with its troubled past provides the backdrop for exploring issues of changing dominant narratives, governance of culture, social welfare, cultural economy, and many others. Through contextualization you will discover the social, cultural, economic and political interdependencies that frame the Cambodian arts ecosystem. You will get to know institutions, individuals, networks and structural frameworks that shape transformation processes in and through the culture sector.  The course is designed to allow for a wide range of engagement with the topic and the country: narration and film, history and theory, performance and experience, site visits and interviews, as well as a group project. The aim of the course is to stimulate discussions, reflect on practices, ideas and visions. You are encouraged to ask questions and discover your own experiences with arts and culture during conflicts, their prevention and dealing with their aftermath. Think of critical situations in places and communities you are attached to and the role of arts in these. Ultimately, it is your creativity and inspiration that will shape the next innovative approach to the use of arts in processes of post-conflict transformation, pre-conflict prevention and peacebuilding.  PLEASE NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.  This course includes a required international trip to Cambodia.	0	0
880	880	PEACE-UH	1116JX	Convivencia: A Model for Living Together	How is it possible that different cultures, religions and civilizations come together without clashing? “Convivencia” has become a new term of formulating this need for a peaceful way to live together, hereby referring to historical experiences. A long period in Spanish history, namely Al-Andalus, has been characterized by this magical word Convivencia. But what is reality, what is ideology, what can be transferred to other regions in the world and to dire contemporary questions, such as how to avoid the world falling into permanent struggle and decline? Understanding the historical situation and its normative context, especially treating the Other as a dhimmi, may help transfer those experiences when Christians, Jews and Muslims found a way to live in relative peace, with respect and interchange present at several levels. Abu Dhabi itself recently discovered evidence of this type of communality between Muslims and Christians. A careful reading of these examples might lead to cautious propositions and hopes for finding solutions to ethnic, religious and civilizational tensions not only on a greater scale, but also on particular grounds in a world that lives for good reasons in the global age.	0	0
881	881	PEACE-UH	1117J	Nation-Building in the Shadow of Empire	Nation-building is a process that is closely tied to post-colonial state formation across the world. In constructing post-colonial political identities, societies have to define membership in the national community and to distinguish themselves from the former colonial masters and neighboring proto-national communities. The process of defining the national community is usually contested and often leads to violence. In many societies, this process is still ongoing. In this class, we will examine the process of post-colonial nation building through the prism of a fascinating and topical case-study, that of contemporary Ukraine. Ukraine continues to struggle to define itself vis-á-vis its former imperial neighbor Russia. In examining the Ukrainian case study, we will ask what a nation is in the contemporary world, how political identities are created and how they take root, and what role the institutions and culture play in the persistence of durable national identities. We will travel to Ukraine, and students will have a chance to directly interact with political entrepreneurs on the frontlines of nation-building. Over the course of the class, students will gain a deeper understanding of the concept of nationalism, the forces and processes behind the construction of durable national identities, and a chance to engage with cutting edge methodological questions in the social sciences.  PLEASE NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.  This course includes a required international trip to Ukraine. This course may not be taken by students who have already taken POLSC-UH 3511J.	0	0
882	882	PHIL-UH	1101	Central Problems in Philosophy	An introduction to the discipline of philosophy by way of several central philosophical problems. Topics may include free will, the nature of the self, skepticism and the possibility of knowledge, the ethics of punishment, the existence of God, the requirements of justice, the relation between our minds and our bodies, the nature of moral principles, and various logical paradoxes.	0	0
883	883	PHIL-UH	1110	The Meaning of Life	Is there a point or significance to life as a whole? That is the question about the “meaning of life.” Though this question is notoriously hard to make precise, in one form or another it has animated much literature and art, and also much philosophy. Some philosophers have provided disheartening answers: life is suffering, and then it ends; life is absurd and never gains any meaning. But other philosophers have provided more uplifting answers that support the quest for personal significance. Bot h kinds of answers deserve scrutiny. After reviewing various pessimistic and more optimistic approaches to the meaning of life, we will turn to the subject of death. We will all die eventually. We normally encounter the death of our family and friend s before we must deal with our own. These themes too are the subject of philosophical reflection. We finish the semester with a discussion of the connection between individual significance and the future of humanity. This class will integrate references to art and literature as well as to science where appropriate, but its main focus is on contributions by recent thinkers in the analytical tradition of philosophy.	0	0
884	884	PHIL-UH	1113	Freedom and Responsibility	Do we have free will? Can we think of ourselves as responsible agents while also regarding ourselves as part of the natural order? Some philosophers have argued that if our actions are causally determined, then freedom of the will is impossible. Others have argued that freedom does not depend on the truth or falsity of causal determinism. Is free will possible in a world where every event is causally determined? Are there different kinds of freedom? If so, are all kinds of freedom equally worth having? Must we act freely in order to be responsible for our actions? Do the social institutions of reward and punishment depend for their justification upon the existence of responsible, free agents? Students will discuss the nature of persons, action, freedom, and responsibility in an effort to answer these questions.	0	0
885	885	PHIL-UH	1115	Fear of Knowledge	It is often thought that knowledge is inherently valuable and that “truth” is an objective notion independent of social considerations. This course examines various reasons we might have for holding these views and various challenges that have been raised against them. Why should we care about knowledge as long as our beliefs prove useful and efficacious? Is truth and thus knowledge more accurately understood as a culturally relative notion, so that what’s true for you might not be true for me?	0	0
886	886	PHIL-UH	1117	Law and Philosophy	This course aims to provide you with a set of analytical tools distinctive of philosophy that will help you to think systematically and critically about issues of legal relevance.  We will begin by exploring foundational issues concerning the nature of the law and its authority over us.  We will then examine whether and how particular patterns of assigning legal responsibility and imposing legal punishment are justified, with an emphasis on the criminal law.	0	0
887	887	PHIL-UH	1810	Introduction to Logic	All philosophers are wise, and Socrates is a philosopher. Therefore, Socrates is wise. The topic of this course is the nature of this “therefore.”   Logic is the science of reasoning, the study of the ways in which statements support or contradict one another. In this course, we will investigate and expose the logical structure of everyday language and see how the correctness or incorrectness of reasoning depends on this structure. To aid discussion, we will develop a formal language that makes this underlying structure more perspicuous. With this formal language as a tool, we will be able to construct elaborate proofs and explore the logical relations among the various steps of complex arguments.	0	0
888	888	PHIL-UH	1910	Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics	Quantum mechanics (QM) continues to fascinate physicists and non-physicists alike in virtue of its strikingly unorthodox characterization of the world. Some of the counter-intuitive features we've learned to accept, whereas others continue to generate controversy. This course begins by introducing students to the basic structure of QM, its experimental basis, and some of the bizarre (if well-established) features of the quantum world. We then examine two conceptual problems in the theory’s foundations the measurement problem and the problem of local beables that threaten to render the entire theoretical edifice incoherent, and survey proposed ways to address those problems. Among the interpretations of quantum mechanics, we'll investigate are spontaneous collapse theories, pilot wave theories, and many-worlds theories, each of which aims to solve existing issues but often at the expense of raising new ones. This is not a 'popular science' course: we’ll be reading physicists and philosophers who engage substantively with the foundational questions. However, there are no prerequisites, and none of the texts we use presuppose any familiarity with either QM or philosophy.	0	0
889	889	PHIL-UH	2210	Ancient Mediterranean Philosophy	This course is an examination of the origins of Western philosophical thought in ancient Greece and Rome, with a special focus on the views of Plato and Aristotle. Through their work, students will grapple with a range of pressing philosophical questions, including: Is happiness more than a subjective state of consciousness? Is death harmful? Do we have free will? Do we have obligations to others that override the pursuit of our own self-interest? What is the relation between the mind (or the soul) and the body? Since most of the philosophers that will be studied thought that philosophy must be systematic, we will also try to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this kind of approach to philosophical questions.	0	0
890	890	PHIL-UH	2211X	Classical Arabic Philosophy	An introduction to Arabic philosophy as developed and debated by Muslims, Christians, and Jews from the eighth to the twelfth century. The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics for this course include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.	0	0
891	891	PHIL-UH	2212	Classical Indian Philosophy	An exploration of the thought of major philosophers from the Indian subcontinent, beginning with the ancients in the fifth century BCE and concluding with thinkers on the eve of colonialism in the eighteenth century CE. Indian philosophy has been and continues to be a major world philosophy. The reach of its ideas has been vast, both historically and geographically, spanning the philosophies of Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, and Hinduism, as well as the philosophy of law, of medicine, of mathematics, and of politics and society. It is most strongly associated with wide-ranging discussions in the philosophy of mind, the study of language, epistemology, and metaphysics. The aim of the course is to present a balanced and impartial picture of the richness, diversity, and depth of philosophy in this region.	0	0
892	892	PHIL-UH	2222	Early Modern European Philosophy	This course is a survey of European philosophy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, one of the most important and exciting times in the history of philosophy. We will be focusing on six philosophers who lived and worked in this period: René Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Through their writings, we will trace and study philosophical arguments and debates concerning the possibility and extent of our knowledge of the external world, the nature of the self, the nature of substance and causation, the existence of God, and the relation between our minds and our bodies.	0	0
893	893	PHIL-UH	2223	Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century European Philosophy	A survey of philosophy on the European continent in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beginning with German Idealism and proceeding through Marxism, existentialism, phenomenology, critical theory, and structuralism. This course will introduce students to many of the major thinkers of this period, including Hegel, Marx, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Arendt, Sartre, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Foucault. These philosophers stand in the background of a great deal of contemporary political, social, and literary theory: their reactions to and criticisms of the Enlightenment’s celebration of reason continue to challenge modern society.	0	0
894	894	PHIL-UH	2224	Classical Chinese Philosophy	This course examines the intellectual development of early Chinese philosophical thought by focusing on four major schools: Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism. Through the translated writings of various representative thinkers, including Confucius, Mozi, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Xunzi, Han Feizi, and Mencius, we will explore questions about human nature, ethics, moral psychology, and self-cultivation.	0	0
895	895	PHIL-UH	2410	Epistemology	Epistemology is the study of knowledge and rational belief. In this course we will examine various central epistemological questions, including: What is knowledge, and how does it differ from belief? Can we ever know that the world actually is the way it appears to us, or must we concede to the skeptic that we do not really know anything? Does knowledge always have to be based on secure foundations? If you know something, will you always know that you know it? Will you always be able to prove that you know it? What sort of attitude is belief, and what sort of control do we have over what we believe? What is evidence, and what is the connection between knowledge and evidence? Do we have any good reasons to believe some things rather than others? Is it ever rational to believe in the absence of evidence? What should we do when our epistemic peers disagree with us?	0	0
896	896	PHIL-UH	2411	Metaphysics	Metaphysics is the investigation of the nature of reality. In this course we will wrestle with some of the most fundamental questions such as: What kinds of things exist? Are there minds or material bodies? What, for that matter, is existence? Is change illusory? What is truth? To what extent is reality independent of our thoughts about it? What is the difference between the possible and the actual? Are human actions free or causally determined? What is a person?	0	0
897	897	PHIL-UH	2412	Philosophy of Language	“Socrates was poisoned.” With those vocal sounds or marks on a page, I can make a claim about someone who lived in the distant past. How is that possible? How do our words manage to pick out or latch onto particular portions of reality, even ones with which we’ve never had any contact? How does language enable us to convey thoughts about everything from Abu Dhabi, to the hopes of a friend, to the stars beyond our galaxy? For that matter, what are the thoughts, or the meanings, that our words carry or communicate? We will explore these and other philosophical questions about language through a reading of seminal works by twentieth-century thinkers.	0	0
898	898	PHIL-UH	2413	Philosophy of Mind	The course will be an examination of the relationship between mind, body, and brain. How does this hunk of meat relate to the rich and variegated mental lives we experience every day? We consider various attempts to grapple with one of the oldest problems in philosophy—the mind/body problem. Topics to be covered include dualism vs. materialism, eliminativism, behaviorism, identity theory, functionalism, the computational theory of mind, and the hard problem of consciousness.	0	0
899	899	PHIL-UH	2414	Philosophy of Science	Science is often taken to be a distinctly rational form of empirical inquiry. This course examines various questions concerning the nature and practice of science that arise from this widespread attitude. For example, scientific theories are often thought to be subject to empirical scrutiny in ways that other theories are not. To what extent is this belief well-founded? Is it rational to believe that our best scientific theories are even approximately true? What justifies the claim that different types of evidence lend varying degrees of support to a particular theory, or that a single piece of evidence supports one theory more than another? Similarly, it is often claimed that scientific theories provide us with “real” explanations of physical phenomena, whereas other theories aren’t “genuinely explanatory.” To what extent is this true? What exactly is a scientific explanation, and how is it different (if at all) from a mere prediction or mathematical derivation? Can false theories provide good explanations? Some familiarity with science would be helpful but is not required.	0	0
900	900	PHIL-UH	2415	Philosophy of Mathematics	This course examines a variety of issues in the metaphysics and epistemology of mathematics. Mathematics poses interesting questions for philosophers. Mathematical statements appear to state objective truths, but it is difficult to see what the grounds of that truth are. Does mathematics somehow depend on us and our practices? Is it grounded in logic? Does it instead depend on the arrangement of some pre-existing objects, “the numbers”? These numbers appear not to be located in space-time. If they are not, how do we come to know about them? What explains the tremendous success of mathematics in providing useful applications in other disciplines? What does it take for something to count as a mathematical “proof”? We consider some surprising mathematical results, including Godel’s incompleteness theorems, multiple sizes of infinity, and the status of the continuum hypothesis, and examine their philosophical significance. This is a course in the philosophy, not the practice, of mathematic s. No specific mathematical knowledge or skills will be assumed. Students will, however, be asked to cope with sometimes difficult and abstract mathematical concepts.	0	0
901	901	PHIL-UH	2416	Images	Images depict, words describe. A picture of the cat of the mat depicts the cat as being on the mat.  The sentence 'the cat is on the mat' describes the cat as being on the mat. Both represent the world as being in a certain state, but they do so in different ways. What is the difference in these ways of representing? What does it take for an image to depict? This course covers most major theories of depiction, including resemblance, experience, recognition, pretense, and structuraltheories. We then expand the scope of inquiry to include topics such as systems of depiction, analog vs. digital representation, maps, film, comics, maps, mental imagery, and relations to the cognitive science of vision.	0	0
902	902	PHIL-UH	2610	Ethics	What are our most basic values? What are the ethical principles by which we should judge our actions, ourselves, and our lives? What is involved in living a good human life? How can we reconcile the demands of morality with the personal obligations that spring from friendships and other relationships? Do the ends ever justify the means? This course will grapple with these and other questions through exploration of three of the most influential theories in Western ethical philosophy: Aristotle’s ethics of virtue, Immanuel Kant’s moral rationalism, and John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism. Students will also encounter one of modern morality’s harshest critics: Friedrich Nietzsche.	0	0
903	903	PHIL-UH	2611	Applied Ethics	Torture, abortion, taxes, physician-assisted suicide, terrorism. People disagree fiercely about the morality of these and countless other human concerns. What moral theories and concepts shape these debates? Can we use these debates to refine or evaluate those theories and concepts? Is it possible to find common ground in shared ethical principles that will allow us to engage in rational debates rather than in disrespectful shouting matches (or worse)? These topics will be the guiding questions in this course as we investigate several contemporary moral controversies.	0	0
904	904	PHIL-UH	2614	Political Philosophy	The state has authority over its citizens: if you fail to comply with its dictates, you can be punished. What justifies the state’s exercise of such authority? Could it be justified because we have at least implicitly given our consent to it? This is only one central question in political philosophy. Others include: What form of government best serves the people? Who are the people, anyway? What is justice? Do we have fundamental rights to property or to free expression? If so, what is the source of these rights? What is freedom, and are there different kinds? What is the proper relation between freedom and equality? Is equality desirable? Can we live in a genuine community that is not a community of equals? Students will grapple with such questions and draw on writings from both classical and contemporary philosophers.	0	0
905	905	PHIL-UH	2810	Advanced Logic	This course is an advanced investigation of various aspects of symbolic logic and reasoning, with an emphasis on subjects of philosophical relevance. Specific topics vary by semester, but are generally drawn from the following: modal logic (the study of reasoning about necessity, possibility, counterfactuals, and tense); metalogic (the study of provability, completeness, and other higher-order properties of logical systems); nonclassical logic (the study of three-valued logical systems, free logics, and the logic of relevance); and mathematical logic (the study of logical systems intended to model arithmetic reasoning).	0	0
906	906	PHIL-UH	3210	Topics in the History of Philosophy	An advanced seminar that involves the careful study of some particular movement, philosopher, or issue in the history of philosophy. Examples: Aristotle, Ibn Sina, Kant, German Idealism, theories of causation in Indian philosophy, vice in the global history of philosophy.	0	0
907	907	PHIL-UH	3410	Topics in Theoretical Philosophy	An advanced seminar that involves the careful study of some particular theory, philosopher, or set of issues in contemporary theoretical philosophy. Examples: realism and antirealism, David Lewis, theories of truth, formal epistemology, philosophy of logic, consciousness.	0	0
908	908	PHIL-UH	3610	Topics in Practical Philosophy	An advanced seminar that involves the careful study of some particular theory, philosopher, or set of issues in contemporary practical philosophy. Examples: consequentialism, empirical moral psychology, the philosophy of law, the ethics of gender, Rawls, metaethics.	0	0
909	909	PHIL-UH	4000	Capstone Project	The Capstone Project provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to conduct extensive research on a philosophical topic of their choice. The program consists of a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the fall semester, students explore their chosen topic, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and write regular substantive response papers. During the spring semester, students hone their research and produce successive drafts of a thesis, which should be a substantial work of written scholarship. The Capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the completed thesis.	0	0

1029	1029	POLSC-UH	1111	Introduction to Comparative Politics	This course introduces students to the study of comparative politics and the study of domestic political institutions around the world. The course emphasizes the use of theory and evidence to generate and test hypotheses about both the causes and the consequences of the observed variation in domestic political institutions. For example, the course investigates the factors that lead some countries to democratize, and others to institute authoritarian governments, as well as the consequences of those institutional choices for policy outcomes. The course also looks at the variations in institutional arrangements within both democratic and non-democratic governments.	0	0
1030	1030	POLSC-UH	1112	Introduction to International Politics	The goal of this course is to introduce the basic analytical concepts and techniques that are essential for understanding international politics. The course is especially concerned with analytically exploring major issues in international politics, such as the causes of war, the emergence of cooperative trade relations between states, the origins and functioning of international organizations such as the United Nations, and the political determinants of financial crises. The focus of the course is neither historical nor descriptive; rather, it requires students to exercise skills in logic and to think of imaginative ways to apply subtle techniques to gain a clearer grasp of the above political issues.	0	0
1031	1031	POLSC-UH	2211	Data Analysis	Social scientists and policy analysts rely heavily on research drawing on observational data. Students learn to manage and analyze such data and to deploy statistical techniques that are common in these applications, with an emphasis on how to translate social science theory into empirical research. Topics include review of basic regression analysis, building multivariate analytical models, and regression analysis with limited dependent variables. The course emphasizes practical training in these skills as well as evaluation, replication, and critical analysis of research conducted in the social science literature. The course is designed as alternative for students in the social sciences who are not taking Introduction to Econometrics.	0	0
1032	1032	POLSC-UH	2310	Political Psychology	This course addresses key theoretical and empirical topics in political psychology, drawing in both the experimental tradition of social psychology and the survey-based tradition of political science. Consideration is given to the political psychology of collective public behavior, including issues of social identity, intergroup relations, and group interaction, as well as individual political attitude formation and decision-making. Social and psychological antecedents and consequences of political orientation and ideological opinions are also addressed.	0	0
1033	1033	POLSC-UH	2311	Political Economy of Institutions	(Formerly POLSC-AD 133)The course explores recent research on the economic causes and consequences of differences in political institutions: authoritarian vs. democratic in general, and various kinds of authoritarian (military, personalistic, etc.) and democratic (chiefly proportional vs. majoritarian and parliamentary vs. presidential) regimes. Among the economic aspects to be considered are: the wealth and economic inequality in the given society; who garners the rents that the given regime offers; and the degree of oligopoly vs. competition that characterizes economic policy.	0	0
1034	1034	POLSC-UH	2312	Political Economy of Development	It is now widely acknowledged that politics plays a central role in influencing economic development. This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors that explain why some countries are rich and democratic while others are poor, corrupt, and unstable. After discussing the real meaning of development, the course surveys classical and contemporary theories of economic growth and development ranging from neoclassical to structural to recent endogenous growth theories. Specific topics reviewed in the second part of the course include population growth, migration, the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, corruption, social conflict, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries would be used throughout the course.	0	0
1035	1035	POLSC-UH	2313J	Introduction to Machiavelli	Often described as the founder of the modern science of politics, Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527) was also a Florentine diplomat and civil servant who drew upon his deep understanding of Roman history to interpret the colorful, tumultuous, duplicitous and often violent politics of Renaissance Italy. This class will involve a careful reading and analysis of his masterpiece, The Prince, in its historical context, with a focus on its principal theme, namely how and why political leaders gain and lose power or what leaders need to do to create the political loyalty they need to sustain their authority in the periods of adversity that afflict all governments. Students will also study selected portions of The Discourses, in order to understand the nature of Machiavelli’s “republicanism” and how it relates to the advice and warnings he gave to princes. Our readings and discussions will be supplemented by visits to sites and places that influenced his work and commemorate his life.	0	0
1036	1036	POLSC-UH	2314X	Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory	Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.	0	0
1037	1037	POLSC-UH	2315	Justice: Political Theory & Practice	This course invites students to engage with several classic treatises of political thinking about a universal concern: justice. In John Rawls’s words, justice “is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.” To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know? In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?	0	0
1038	1038	POLSC-UH	2316	Gender Parity	(Formerly POLSC-AD 143)This course introduces students to the basic theories, empiricism and methodological concepts of women's and gender studies within political science. Following an overview session about global and regional patterns, each of the subsequent weeks will tackle a series of key gender and politics topics in turn. The course goes beyond gender inequality in the labor market to explore patterns of violence and political participation, among other topics. Lastly, the course provides a basis for research, practical action and policy formulation and for evaluating directions and strategies for social change from a gender perspective.	0	0
1039	1039	POLSC-UH	2317	Identity and Culture in Politics	What role does identity play in politics? Does culture affect political behavior? What is culture? In this course students examine the formation and role of identity in politics—and how identity and culture affect outcomes such as public goods provision, inter-group violence, democratization, and economic growth. Here, identity is not treated as fixed but as constructed, and its formation itself an outcome to be explained. Students will examine identity and its relation to distributive politics, representation, political mobilization, conflict, and coordination. Similarly, culture is not treated as static, but is dynamic. Students will seek to understand changes in culture over time as well as their effect on behavior, and assess different approaches to the study of culture.	0	0
1040	1040	POLSC-UH	2318	Indian Political Thought: Ideas of India	As India’s economic, military, and cultural power expands, it becomes increasingly important for observers to understand the ideas that have shaped and continue to shape its political trajectory. This is especially so because India’s experiment with constitutional democracy constitutes the most significant attempt to date to establish this form of government in the midst of an impoverished, post-colonial, and highly divided society. In this seminar we will examine these ideas in depth. We will study the theories fashioned by the leading Indian intellectuals and statesmen, including Swami Vivekanda, Aurobindo Ghosh, Gopal Gokhale, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mohandas Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Vinayak Savarkar, M. N. Roy, B. R. Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, Jayaprakash Narayan, and Ram Manohar Lohia. We will also examine the Debates of the Constituent Assembly, which explicated the principles and institutions underpinning the Indian Constitution. By the end of the semester, we will be in a position to compare and contrast some of the central themes of Indian political thought since the turn of the twentieth century.	0	0
1041	1041	POLSC-UH	2320J	Diversity and Society	Immigration in Europe, demographic change in the United States, accumulation of inequalities around the world, democratization in developing countries-these are transformative processes that force societies to confront issues of cohesion amidst ethnic, religious, and gender diversity. This course will prepare students to apply a social scientific mindset in thinking through these issues. It will allow students to engage with cutting-edge theoretical, experimental, and observational approaches to understanding the psychological and rational bases of intergroup conflict, processes through which people react to diversity, and ways that institutions promote or stall movement mitigating conflicts. Class assignments allow students to work with data using surveys, laboratory, and field techniques.	0	0
1042	1042	POLSC-UH	2321	Women and Peace-building	Women have vested interest in promoting peace and preventing conflicts. Among other things, this is due to the fact that conflicts usually have gender specific consequences. For example, in addition to injuries, deaths and other losses experienced by all segments of communities during times of violent conflicts and wars; existing inequalities between the sexes in a given society are exacerbated during such times. This course looks at theoretical and practical contributions that women have made to peacemaking & the gendered nature of conflict and humanitarian interventionism since the beginning of the 20th century. The course begins with review of debates that surround women’s involvement in peace action, research and education. Course exposes students to various perspectives, from multiple disciplines, on power, gender oppression, and identities. This course also reviews the phenomena of conflict, forced migration and militarization from different perspectives to highlight policies and operational implications that arise from these different analyses.	0	0
1043	1043	POLSC-UH	2322J	Civil Liberties: Legal and Moral Perspectives	This course will examine major constitutional controversies within the context of wider debates in political and legal theory. Readings will include Supreme Court cases and prominent texts in political and legal theory. Topics will include a mix of federalism, separation of powers, privacy, free speech, religion, race, and gender. We will also focus how political and legal theory helps us to consider these topics in tandem.	0	0
1044	1044	POLSC-UH	2323J	Suffering and Politics	Is suffering a purely private experience or does it have important political dimensions? What are the intersections between suffering and power? What would public policies look like, that would have the minimization of suffering as their main goal? This course traces the political relevance of suffering, from the late 17th century to our time, focusing on how human vulnerability comes to be seen as a reality humans could/should do something about at the dawn of the Enlightenment. We will consider the problems attached to conceptualizing empathy as a political force, especially in contemporary diverse societies, and we will then turn to how images and experiences of suffering have spurred political action in novels, in the creation of social movements, and in the constitution of international legal instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	0	0
1045	1045	POLSC-UH	2324J	Politics of Belonging: Membership, Communities, Nations, and Boundaries	The aim of this course is to explore the nature, scope, means and limits of belonging in modern political societies. We will primarily look at forms of communality (nationalism, communitarianism), and “identity politics” – the construction of social identities (through political participation, memory, language and religion) in order to understand why and how the ideal of modern individualism is determined by thick solidarities and loyalties to fellow nationals; to comprehend why and how we draw boundaries around idealized communities of peers; why we are so prompt to exclude those who are perceived as “strangers”. Liberal democracies are supposed to be “inclusive”, self-governing polities building on political - not ethnic - identities. However, Political membership is not only governed by contract or consent, shared political values and institutions, but also by forms of exclusiveness, and policies of “us” versus “them”. How then are we ought to manage pluralism and diversity?	0	0
1046	1046	POLSC-UH	2325J	Revolution	This course explores political and economic transformation through the lens of revolution: the effort to break from a tyrannical regime and to forge a new political order by establishing territorial sovereignty. Revolutions are routinely depicted as violent and uncompromising. Yet, this course considers the pivotal role revolutionary movements have played in fostering theories of democracy and humanity. In addition to exposing students to theories of revolution from different historical epochs and cultural contexts, this course is structured by four case studies through which we will explore some of the main contradictions that have defined revolutionary movements: the American Revolution;), the Haitian Revolution (the Cuban Revolution; and, finally, the Eritrean Revolution. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Eritrea.	0	0
1047	1047	POLSC-UH	2326	Politics and Finance	This course examines how legislation and regulation influence the structure of financial markets, and how players in these markets intervene in the political process to create or modify legislative and regulatory outcomes. Particular emphasis will be placed on the United States, although international comparisons will also be present. The approach will be similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions will be made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange.	0	0
1048	1048	POLSC-UH	2327	Political Parties	Political parties have been core features of regimes across the world for the last two-hundred years. As such, understanding the role of parties is essential for the study of both political institutions and political behavior. In this course, we examine parties from both a theoretical and empirical lens. We begin by examining why parties form and then proceed to study how they function, what their roles are in both governmental institutions and electoral politics, how the change or die, and other similar questions. For all cases, we draw on historical and contemporary examples from around the globe. Particular emphasis will be placed on exploring the present-day rise of populism and its effects on destabilizing political party systems across the globe.	0	0
1049	1049	POLSC-UH	2328	Comparative Politics of Southeast Asia	This course is an introduction to Southeast Asian comparative politics. Over the past several decades, Southeast Asia has been a particularly dynamic region of the world. The course explores the history of colonialism, the diversity of political regimes, war and conflict, levels of economic development, social complexities, and international relationships with Great Powers, in and across Southeast Asian nations. Examining the diversities within and across countries in this region allows students to understand and compare how politics operates and produces different social and economic outcomes. The first part of the course reviews the politics of individual Southeast Asian nations, including Burma/Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam - and to a lesser extent, Singapore and Cambodia. The second part turns to a series of thematic discussions on issues related to ASEAN nations' constructive engagement, conflict management, and international relations to non-ASEAN states/actors.	0	0
1050	1050	POLSC-UH	2410X	Comparative Politics of the Middle East	Studying comparative politics sheds light on political outcomes in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) by examining divergent trajectories among countries in the region. As such, the course will focus on both the modern political history of MENA states since independence up to the contemporary period, but with an emphasis on the application of social-scientific theories that explain these historical processes. The topics of this course include the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, political Islamist movements, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. Students will also examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the role of parliaments and elections, and the distribution of wealth.	0	0
1051	1051	POLSC-UH	2411	Politics, Social Change & Development in South Asia	How did the borders of South Asian countries come to be formed? What explains the variation in the types of regimes—democratic and authoritarian—across South Asia? To what extent do these countries vary in the structure of their states as well as regimes? How does ethnic diversity affect the politics of South Asian countries? What is the pattern of economic growth across these countries, and their human development record and why? What explains the high levels of violence in some South Asian countries and patterns of variation across these countries? These are some of the questions that this course addresses, with a primary focus on India and a secondary focus on Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, and Bhutan. Although students learn a vast number of facts about the history and politics of the region, the primary purpose of the course is to identify overarching patterns that characterize the politics of these regions—and to teach students to think analytically and comparatively about these patterns.	0	0
1052	1052	POLSC-UH	2412	Power and Politics in America	This course has as a central focus the political institutions of the United States and the effects of those institutions on policy outcomes. The course also places these institutions in the context of those of other wealthy democracies, as a means of illustrating several of the unique features of US political institutions. Topics covered in the course include separation of powers, federalism, and single-member district electoral rules.	0	0
1053	1053	POLSC-UH	2413JX	Bridging the Divide Between the Arab World and the West	(Formerly POLSC-AD 157JX) The course provides students with an opportunity to engage in a multifaceted examination of Arab perceptions of the United States and the West, and Western perceptions of the Arab world. Students review literature and press examples of how Arab and Western media, popular culture, and political commentary portray each other. Students will design and execute a public opinion survey of US and Arab attitudes in order to better understand how each side sees the other—using the poll-driven data to measure the gaps in understanding. The course also includes a televised town hall discussion with the students as participants engaging each other and peers from across the region in an examination of the topic.	0	0
1054	1054	POLSC-UH	2414	African Politics	The goal of this course is to introduce participants to the study of African politics from multiple methodological approaches and in a number of African contexts. The course begins with the historical roots of contemporary African politics, exploring how pre-colonial institutions and colonialism shaped African politics at independence. Next the course will survey the political and economic strategies of leaders post-independence and the factors shaping those strategies. The course includes an examination of the causes and consequences of poor governance, and evaluates the recent patterns of redemocratization on the continent. The course closes with a discussion of present-day challenges: electoral malfeasance, public health crises, the “new” populism, and China in Africa.	0	0
1055	1055	POLSC-UH	2415	Democracy and Development in Eastern Europe and Russia	The aim of this course is to provide a broad overview of Eastern European politics over the course of the 20th century and into the present in order to explain contemporary variation in the levels of democracy and development across the region. The course begins with an examination of the state of Europe at the collapse of continental empires and will then consider the evolution of Communism as an ideology and an actual social, political, and economic practice. The bulk of the course is dedicated to the post-1989 period. Students will explore why some Eastern European countries were quick to democratize and liberalize, while others retrenched. Much of the course is focused on the evolution of society, economy, and polity in Russia. However, discussion will also include developments in all the former Soviet republics and, in a more cursory manner, across the former Communist bloc from Poland to Hungary.	0	0
1056	1056	POLSC-UH	2416	Health and Governance	Health outcomes, such as infant and child survival, have improved dramatically over the past two decades, even in the world’s poorest countries. Yet every year, there are millions of preventable deaths. Many of these deaths occur in countries with very poor governance. What is the relationship between health and governance? How does the provision of effective health services affect government legitimacy, and vice versa? What are the roles of non-governmental actors in health care provision, and under what circumstances can the work of these actors be beneficial or detrimental to health outcomes and governance? What role do international organizations play in improving global health? The course examines these questions, and includes case studies of global health successes and failures, including smallpox eradication and the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Students will explore both historical and contemporary health issues, drawing on insights from political science, biology, and economics.	0	0
1057	1057	POLSC-UH	2417J	Post-communist Democracy and Authoritarianism	(Formerly POLSC-AD 192J)This course introduces students to the politics of the post-communist transition by focusing on three key aspects of regime change in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The first part covers the collapse of communism and the initial regime changes in the region, which ranged from rapid and significant democratization in East-Central Europe to authoritarian persistence in much of the former Soviet Union and parts of the Balkans. The second part analyzes the successes and failures of subsequent democratization efforts in countries that had not democratized successfully during the first round, with a particular focus on the “Colored Revolutions” of Serbia, Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, and the more recent Euromaidan Revolution in Ukraine. In the final part we address the drivers of authoritarian backsliding both among some of the former Soviet Republics (especially Russia) and the more recent wave in some of the region’s erstwhile democratic models, such as Hungary and Poland.	0	0
1058	1058	POLSC-UH	2418J	Nationalism and Identity Politics	(Formerly POLSC-AD 165J) The aim of this course is to explore the nature, scope, means and limits of nation building and nationalism and their inevitable corollary: identity politics. Civic-republican and ethno-nationalist conceptions of the nation, whatever their fundamental differences, were both based on the assumption that a people wishing to exist politically could and should have its own state, the relevant collective identity (nationality), defined in ethnic, linguistic, racial, religious or purely political terms. Historically, it was assumed that some variant of nationalism, the most important ideology of nation states, was itself the best response to the question of how to integrate and govern diversity. Self-determination of peoples was the slogan - the representative nation state, the solution to the problem of social plurality.  Where do we stand today? Challenged by new forms of identity politics (religious, ethnic, tribal), the classical understanding of nationhood must be revised in the light of democratic justice in a globalized age.	0	0

1060	1060	POLSC-UH	2420J	Who are You Israel? A look into the Old-New Middle East neighbor	There are not many individuals in the world, who do not know Israel. Who did not hear something, good or bad, about it? Many have strong opinions about this small country. During the term the students will be introduce to two axes content in an attempt to have a better understanding of this the turbulent. One - the chronological framework, of the Jewish people in general and the Israeli society in particular. Two - examine the content, stressing existential issues and ideological positions that guide this society or tear it from within. The course will have three segments: 1. The Jewish people from ancient history up until contemporary significance. A comprehensive exploration of history, diasporas, prominent people, influential communities. Changes, trends and dynamics. 2. The inner Israeli story. The keys for its impressive successes, the map of its weaknesses. A learning of its fundamental political ideologies, powers and significant institutions. Its demography and religious tensions and the crucial role of the Trauma (the Holocaust) as the corner stone of national strategy. 3. Israel and the neighborhood. Exploring the potentials frictions between Israel and the region.	0	0
1061	1061	POLSC-UH	2421X	Political Economy of the Middle East	This course examines the political ramifications of the way that economic resources are produced and distributed in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Students will examine a range of political-economic issues both in historical context and current debates. The class will cover post-colonial development initiatives and their long-term ramifications on MENA states; current issues of economic redistribution, social services and inequality; the implementation of liberalization programs and the rise of crony capitalism; the role of oil in economic development and state formation in the Gulf; and the ramifications of widespread youth unemployment in the region. Students will be expected to write a research paper examining data on a current political-economic topic from the region and its relevance to politics in one or more Middle Eastern countries.	0	0
1062	1062	POLSC-UH	2422X	North African Politics	This seminar-style course constitutes a comparative study of the post-colonial politics of the North African region – specifically the states of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Through a combination of intensive reading, in-class discussion, and writing, students will develop an in-depth understanding of the politics in these four individual states and comparisons between them. This course aims to identify the most significant specificities of the region’s politics, whilst connecting common themes with wider politics in and beyond the Middle East (e.g. Islamism, the political role of the military, the salience of sub-national ethnic identities, and anti-corruption struggles for political accountability). This course is divided into two main parts. The first focuses on eight essential aspects of North African politics across the four countries: the historical impact of colonialism, processes of post-independence nation-building and development, political economy, and the role of important actors including the military, political parties, Islamist movements, and Berber movements. The second dives into the political dynamics that have shaped, and in some cases transformed, politics in North Africa during and since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, including both domestic factors and the regional and international relations of the four states.	0	0
1063	1063	POLSC-UH	2511	International Organizations	This course covers the formal theory of international cooperation, including the reasons why countries choose to cooperate, bargaining over and enforcement of international agreements, and multilateralism. The remainder of the course discusses empirical examples including peacekeeping, collective security, economic and environmental cooperation, human rights treaties, and arms control.	0	0
1064	1064	POLSC-UH	2512J	Understanding Insurgency and Counterinsurgency	(Formerly POLSC-AD 178J)Insurgencies continue to be a major threat to peace in developing countries. How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency. Students then travel to Kathmandu, Nepal to meet with participants in Nepal's 10-year civil war from 1996 to 2006 and learn their perspectives on these questions obtained from their experiences.	0	0
1065	1065	POLSC-UH	2513J	Political Conflict and Economic Development	Film, video and photography play a vital role in preserving cultural memory. The course studies organizations that collect this material and examines the cultural purposes they serve.  It presents theories explaining the human habit of collecting and its relation to memory.  BA is a fascinating site for learning what role media can play in memorialization. The “Dirty War” (1976-1983) still marks its institutions; its impact of censorship and human destruction still shape the daily work of archivists. While grassroots activity insists on the presence of the “disappeared,” cultural institutions, as well as families, can confront the complete loss of an archive. Recently, new laws have supported the establishment of numerous new memory organizations.  Museums, artists, and activist groups have found routes to memorialization, through curating or making film; erecting topographies of memory in the physical landscape; building parks of memory at critical sites; and understanding “Things as Bridges” to social experience e.g. memory and history as graspable through encounters with objects.  The course links to broader matters of social justice and human rights.	0	0
1066	1066	POLSC-UH	2514	Political Economy of International Trade	(Formerly POLSC-AD 180)This course covers five major topics in international political economy: international trade and trade policy (tariffs, quotas, trade agreements); international migration and remittances; offshoring and outsourcing; international finance (exchange rates, cross-border investment, central bank policy); crises of the international economy: the 1930s, 2007–2009, and the current crises of the Euro and of European sovereign debt.	0	0
1067	1067	POLSC-UH	2515JX	Islamic Extremism	(Formerly POLSC-AD 186JX)The terrorist attacks of 9/11 transformed the foreign policy of the United States and re-shaped its national psyche. Subsequent attacks in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere have focused the world’s attention on the problem of Islamic terrorism. In this class we will seek to understand both the causes of the sudden rise of violent extremism in the Muslim world and the response it has provoked. This course will examine the evolution of the threat, from Al Qaeda to the Islamic State, and consider evaluate responses by Western and Arab nations. In addition to reading about the origins and the spread of jihadism and the policies adopted by concerned states, we will meet with scholars, journalists, policy experts, diplomats and officials in the Obama administration. Students will write a series of short papers and a longer project proposing a course of action to cure, or at least mitigate, the extremist threat.	0	0
1068	1068	POLSC-UH	2516	United Nations	This course examines the United Nations’ origin, processes and impact within both global and local contexts. The UN system, comprised of multiple organs, programs, funds and agencies, is a critical actor in international politics. It performs a large variety of daunting tasks ranging from keeping the peace in war-torn countries to fighting the spread of contagious diseases and facilitating negotiations to limit climate change’s impact. While its status as the preeminent international organization is undisputed, its member states limit the UN’s authority and both governments and NGOs frequently critique its structure and effectiveness. This course rigorously explores why the UN was established in 1945, how it has evolved, what challenges it faces today and whether avenues exist for meaningful organizational reform. The course will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of the UN’s activities and will encourage students to use different theoretical approaches and available empirical evidence to think creatively about how the UN can more effectively address global challenges.	0	0
1069	1069	POLSC-UH	2517JQ	Modeling Politics and International Relations	This course provides a gentle introduction to modeling political behavior, using game theory to investigate political problems. Topics will include the policy position of political parties (the median voter problem), allocating cabinet positions within governments (divide the dollar problem), use of the Presidential veto (and other agenda setting problems) and how political institutions affect the types of policies government implement (selectorate theory). International relations problems will also be considered: models of bargaining and war, arms expenditures, the democratic peace and the provision of foreign aid. For instance, recently US President Trump has told NATO members that they need to spend more of defense. Using a model of collective action we will see why the US spends so much more that its NATO allies and how changes in threats over time have affected the imbalance in spending. The course assumes no prior mathematical modeling, although students should not be afraid of math. Students should expect to use basic algebra to solve problems (if you can solve two equations for two unknowns then you have all the required math skills).	0	0
1070	1070	POLSC-UH	2519	Nuclear Politics	This course focuses on the politics of nuclear weapons. Why do states seek nuclear weapons? What advantages do they provide to states in international crises? What explains the variation of states' reactions to another state’s pursuit of nuclear technology? When do non-proliferation deals emerge, and what explains their content? To answer these questions, we will review the relevant academic literature on the spread of nuclear weapons, and study the histories of various nuclear programs. While some of the literature we will cover uses game theory, there are no prerequisites for this course.	0	0
1071	1071	POLSC-UH	2522J	Global Crisis in the European Context	Political and economic crises around the world in recent years have been attributed to the globalization of trade, finance, and human flows. In this course we will address the central characteristics of the most recent wave of globalization, engaging with the analyses of leading scholars of this recent wave across multiple disciplines.  We will also evaluate the potential causal links between the economic phenomena described in the above literature and recent political crises in several countries, most notably Greece, Poland, Hungary, France, the UK, and Turkey.	0	0
1072	1072	POLSC-UH	2524J	Space Diplomacy	Can you imagine a day without satellites? You will be astonished about the number of things you cannot do anymore if this happens. Students will explore the importance of space activities for life on Earth and for sustainable development. The course will provide in-depth knowledge of the major space programs developed in international cooperation, showing how space is a tool for diplomacy. It will give an overview of the status of the development of the space sector in the world, and of the various kinds of organizations that operate in the space sector. Students will learn key elements for defining and developing new space programs in cooperation at international level, and will realize that the same elements are common to management and leadership in other areas of science and technology. Students will learn how to negotiate on space activities in an international environment. The importance of a global strategy for preserving outer space for future generations will be underlined. The course is by nature interdisciplinary, and addresses a subject very inspirational and at the same time very concrete in terms of real life applications.	0	0
1073	1073	POLSC-UH	2525J	Power Relations Theory	The course provides models, tools and insights to understand the international context by integrating economic analysis with the major theories of International Relations. The course is organized in two parts. The first part deals with the global challenges to international relations related to conflict. We will analyze the incentives to enter conflict of various kinds by State and non-State actors, and the necessary modification of our perspective with the growing prominence of civil wars and mass displacements. The last part focuses on the contribution of IR theories to the understanding of the European integration process, the functioning of European Institutions, the desirability and functioning of different types of international organizations, and finally the problems related to globalization processes. The students will be assigned  a case study where they will need to show in what way the theories studied in the course can be helpful to understand foreign policy decisions and in particular the potential consequences.	0	0
1074	1074	POLSC-UH	2527	Politics of International Law	This course draws on readings from the disciplines of political science and international law to examine how strategic international and domestic politics influence international law, and vice versa. Core topics include treaties and custom; state responsibility; bargaining and cooperation in the enforcement of international law; commitment and compliance; and the politics and law of international adjudication, arbitration, and prosecution. Special coverage is given to law on the use of force, international criminal law, human rights law, and landmark cases from the International Court of Justice, International Criminal Court, United Nations tribunals, European Court of Justice, and World Trade Organization. An original research project, homework, and exams are required.	0	0
1075	1075	POLSC-UH	2528	International Diplomacy in Theory and Practice	This course will examine the role of diplomacy in statecraft, and how governments use various methods of negotiation to pursue outcomes that advance their national interests.  Students will first be introduced to theories of negotiation and the international legal bases for diplomatic relations.  The course will then transition into a closer examination of the different types of diplomacy that states undertake, such as bilateral, multilateral, coercive, developmental, and crisis, drawing on actual case studies to illustrate each.  Taking yet a closer look at diplomacy in practice, participants will explore what diplomacy entails from a practitioner’s point of view, as seen from an embassy or a foreign ministry.  Studying modern, real-life cases of diplomacy in action will allow students to better understand the strategies that states pursue to secure their national security objectives, both successfully and unsuccessfully.	0	0
1076	1076	POLSC-UH	2529J	Fulfilling the Promise of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030	In 2015, Heads of State gathered at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York to agree seventeen goals, to be delivered over fifteen years, with the aim of furthering peace, prosperity and the sustainability of the planet. The aim of this course is to explore how, between now and 2030, the global community can fulfil this promise. The course will explore the impact of the climate crisis and the influence of governance, state fragility, conflict, and migration flows and explore whether the existing multilateral framework can overcome current pressures to make the Sustainable Development Goals agenda a reality. We will consider both the changing political environment and the fiscal constraints in donor countries to identify and understand their effect on government support and public attitudes towards the delivery of the SDGs. The course will evaluate the role of both public sector and private sector finance, and will challenge students to consider how governments, businesses, organizations, institutions and individuals can help deliver the SDGs over the coming decade.	0	0
1077	1077	POLSC-UH	2910	Business, Politics, and Society	Business, Politics, & Society (BPS) is a case-based MBA-style course that introduces students to the political economy of firms. Substantively, the course focuses on the political and social underpinnings of the market system, analyzes corporate political strategy and corporate social responsibility, and presents tools for assessing and mitigating risks, especially as they relate to politics, law/regulation, ethics, and other actors in society. The goal of the course is to help students to learn to structure and solve complex problems in dynamic global markets. Case studies from a variety of countries and industries will be supplemented with academic readings.	0	0
1078	1078	POLSC-UH	2911	Environmental Politics	Many of contemporary environmental challenges are global in scope: issues, such as climate change, air pollution, biodiversity loss, clean water access, ozone layer depletion, overfishing and deforestation, transcend borders. Addressing these environmental threats requires international cooperation. This can be difficult since there is no global authority to enforce agreements between countries or to ensure that all countries contribute to international efforts. This course will analyze the nature of environmental problems and differences between countries in their domestic demand for environmental protection. The course will then consider cross-national characteristics of environmental problems and their implications for global action, as well as the effect of international political and economic conditions on environmental cooperation. The goal of the course is to explore how ideas, interests, interactions, and institutions shape global environmental politics.	0	0
1079	1079	POLSC-UH	2912	Politics of Natural Resources	Do abundant natural resources undermine democracy? Do they have a positive or negative effect on economic development? Is there a relationship between natural resources and interstate or intrastate conflict? This course will explore the politics of natural resources. It will analyze the effect of natural resources on a variety of economic and political issues, including growth, inequality, corruption, political stability, violence, human rights, and democracy. The course will also investigate how political institutions and economic conditions modify the effect of natural resources. Several contemporary issues, such as sustainable resource use and alternative energy, will be considered in detail. Recent empirical research on the politics of natural resources, as well as case studies from different regions of the world, will provide foundation for discussion.	0	0
1080	1080	POLSC-UH	2913J	Electing the President: An Up-close Look at How American  Elections Really Work	This course seeks to provide students with a genuine understanding of the American electoral process – specifically what it takes to run for and become president.  From raising money to crafting a message, from grassroots organization to debate preparation, from social media to traditional media, students will see up close and firsthand the specific skills and techniques utilized by the men and women who seek to become president – and how voters interpret those efforts in their decision-making process. What makes this class essential is the interaction with and instruction by the candidates, the consultants, the journalists, and the voters themselves – in real time – as the two most important events in the presidential calendar – the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary – play out in front of them.  The most influential people in American politics will provide students with an unprecedented opportunity to learn from those who shape and wield these political tools masterfully.  By hearing, seeing, and questioning the key people in these fields, students will develop their own perspectives on the health and viability of the American democratic process.  PLEASE NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.	0	0
1081	1081	POLSC-UH	3310J	State Formation	(Formerly POLSC-AD 144J)This seminar studies why states form, what types of states form, and what they do. Over the course of the semester students will consider these questions by using both current and historical evidence combined with the methods of modern political science. A sample of topics investigated includes formation of nation states vs. alternative state types, ungoverned spaces, state capacity, the emergence of property rights, foundations of popular rule, and public goods provision.	0	0
1082	1082	POLSC-UH	3312J	Social Media and Political Participation	In this course we examine the effect of social media on political participation.  Social media is defined as any sort of platform-based two-way communication, often referred to as Web 2.0.  The most well-known examples of social media are Facebook and Twitter, but includes a host of other platforms including Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, Weibo, YouTube, What’s App, etc. Political participation is defined any activity taken by ordinary citizens (i.e., not “elite” political actors such as politicians) in the political realm. In this course, we explore theories of political behavior and then examine the relationship between social media and politics. Students towards a final project involving both quantitative and qualitative analysis of social media usage by a member of the United States congress and will be taught how to use the programming tools necessary to analyze social media data themselves as part of preparing for this final project.  As part of this project, there will be a two-day field trip to Washington DC that will include interviews with the social media coordinators for the Member of Congress the students are analyzing.	0	0
1083	1083	POLSC-UH	3410X	Iraq War and its Consequences	(Formerly POLSC-AD 163X)This course will examine the political consequences for Middle Eastern and global affairs of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, focusing on the causes and effects of sectarian strife, state breakdown, conflicting economic interests, the role of outside powers pursuing their own agendas, the territorial disintegration of the country, and the rise of ISIS. Readings will include historical, journalistic and social scientific writings covering all dimensions of the conflict and its convulsive consequences.	0	0
1084	1084	POLSC-UH	3411J	Gender Revolutions and the State in India	"(Formerly POLSC-AD 185J)This course asks two questions: Why do states conduct top-down reforms for gender equality? What are impacts of these interventions? Students will study these questions in the context of India, the world’s largest and most influential developing democracy, with some of the most complex, puzzling variation in economic and social rights. Specifically, the course will examine reforms that equalize women’s rights to a core economic and social commodity: land. These reforms represent the hardest and most important reforms for the state to implement. The class will travel to India to interview top government officials and leaders responsible for implementing gender-equalizing land inheritance reform across India’s diverse cultural, economic, and political landscape.PLEASE NOTE: This course contains an international trip and counts as an ""Abu Dhabi-based Course with a Trip” for first-year students. For upper-class students, this counts as an ""Away J-Term course.”  This course is open to NYU Abu Dhabi students only."	0	0
1085	1085	POLSC-UH	3510	International Political Economy	This course serves as an introduction to the workings of the contemporary international political-economic system and introduces students to some of the main analytical frameworks that political economists use to understand this system. The course seeks to familiarize students with analytical tools that help them gain a better understanding of the current problems and opportunities facing actors in today’s international political economy.	0	0
1086	1086	POLSC-UH	3511J	Nation-Building	Nation-Building explores the range of strategies which strong states use in order to build the capacity of weak ones. This issue is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is “democracy promotion” a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. The class will visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.	0	0
1087	1087	POLSC-UH	3512	Civil Wars and International Intervention	Civil war continues to be one of the most vexing problems in comparative and international politics. Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? This course will address these questions. It is broken into five substantive blocks, starting with an introduction to the concepts and patterns of war-related conflict around the globe, the factors that bring about civil wars, the dynamics of civil conflicts, followed by its consequences, and then moving on to what, if anything, countries and the international community can do to ameliorate this problem. The inter-disciplinary course draws on political science, behavioral economics, social psychology, history and anthropology, along with some research in natural sciences.	0	0
1088	1088	POLSC-UH	3513J	Emerging Powers	(Formerly POLSC-AD 183J)Are Emerging Powers emerging, and are they powers? The course will consider the emerging “market” or economic discussion, reviewing what academics, the press, financial institutions, etc., mean when they speak of these countries, with acronyms such as BRICs, BRICS, MINT, and others. What is the key factor: size, growth, novelty, potential or promise? Which of all of these questions is truly relevant and important? The second part of the class will examine regional, geopolitical issues: are these countries important actors in their regions? Why or why not, and how does their economic performance influence their regional political action (domestic ideological and institutional issues would also be rapidly addressed here)? The third part of the class will turn to international and multilateral factors: are “emerging powers” truly powers? Are they all the same? Do others see them as powers? How do they express their economic success or geographic and demographic clout in the international arena?	0	0
1089	1089	POLSC-UH	3516J	Surviving the 21st Century: Power and Statecraft in the Digital Age	Technology is rapidly transforming how states and individuals interact and power functions. In the midst of so much change, what can we learn from the history and practice of diplomacy about how to thrive in a century like no other. The class will study new forms of power; how to build brand and influence; the geopolitical challenges ahead; and how we can maximize the opportunities of technology to manage the threats it creates. We will learn from inspirational leaders in their fields, and work together to design the solutions to the challenges of the Digital Age. It is the first course to be co-designed by J-Term students, and will be dominated by simulations, interactive class exercises and problem solving. NOTE: This course has an International trip to Jordan.	0	0

1091	1091	POLSC-UH	4001	Capstone Project	Students develop a research question, construct a research design that allows them to test potential answers to that question, collect relevant data, analyze the results, and write a senior thesis.	0	0
1092	1092	PSYCH-UH	1001	Introduction to Psychology	Introduction to the fundamental principles of psychology, emphasizing both the unity and diversity of a field that spans major theoretical and research areas, including biological bases of human behavior, learning, cognition, perception, language, development, motivation, as well as social and abnormal behavior. Opportunities to apply knowledge gained in lectures and readings are available through computer-based demonstrations, in-class exercises, and required field experiences.	0	0
1093	1093	PSYCH-UH	1002EQ	Research Methods in Psychology	Knowledge acquired through scientific research is bounded by the conditions under which the research is carried out. Consequently, informed consumers of information must understand how scientific research is carried out in order to decide what is true. This course provides an introduction to scientific research methods in psychological science, experimental design, and data interpretation. Students develop an appreciation for the methods involved in carrying out research on issues in psychology and, hopefully, become critical - but not cynical - consumers of scientific results, learning to distinguish sound conclusions from those based on faulty reasoning or flawed studies. Students in this course gain real experience by designing and conducting an experiment of their own, and presenting and reporting their results.	0	0
1094	1094	PSYCH-UH	1003	Biopsychology	Biopsychology is the study of the biological basis of behavior. In this course, students discover connections among psychology and biology, pharmacology, and endocrinology. Lectures cover the structure, function, and development of the human nervous system and how this system can give rise to basic sensory, motor, cognitive, and regulatory processes that characterize human behavior. This course uses examples of the effects of brain damage and nervous system disorders to provide insight into how pathological thoughts and behaviors are rooted in physiological causes. Additionally, students develop a basic understanding of the methods used in biopsychology and evaluate the contributions as well as limitations of these approaches.	0	0
1095	1095	PSYCH-UH	1004Q	Statistics for Psychology	Statistics form a critical component of research, and this course is designed to introduce students to the foundations of statistical principles in psychological science. This course covers basic-level statistics concepts such as central tendency and variability; the theory and logic underlying hypothesis testing and statistical decision-making; and the basic principles behind linear models commonly used in psychology, including correlations, t-tests, analysis of variance, and basic regression. The course also introduces students to basic statistical computer programs.	0	0
1096	1096	PSYCH-UH	2210	Developmental Psychology	The course considers current theoretical issues and research in developmental psychology in an effort to understand how we develop as perceiving, thinking, and feeling beings. Throughout the semester, theories, methods and interdisciplinary findings are explored, covering physical/biological foundations of development, cognitive processes, social and emotional development. The course explores how various systems and contexts shape an individual’s development, with a focus on risk and resilience. Attention is given to applying current research findings to trends in policy and intervention. Moreover, the course links conceptual frameworks to applied areas in the field of developmental psychology. The course also considers dynamics of culture, society, and social change on human development.	0	0
1097	1097	PSYCH-UH	2211	Social Psychology	This course covers a wide range of topics in social psychology. Social psychology illustrates how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by social situations and the real or imagined presence of others (including parents, peers, authorities, and groups). This course covers several important subfields in social psychology, and uses this knowledge to understand and address social problems. Concepts discussed are attitudes, values, roles, norms, communication and conformity; areas emphasized are group processes, influence, social motivation, prejudice and authoritarianism.	0	0
1098	1098	PSYCH-UH	2212	Psychology of Language	This course is an introduction to the psychology of language (or psycholinguistics), which is the study of how humans acquire, comprehend and produce language, and how language relates to perception and other mental faculties like reasoning and memory. The course covers how language is put to use in real-time during comprehension and production, how it is acquired by children, how it may break down in specific patterns when the brain is compromised, and how it informs social attitudes toward speakers of other languages/dialects. Lectures in this class survey the major findings in these areas, discuss their implications for theories of language in the mind, and focus on the research techniques used by psycholinguists.	0	0
1099	1099	PSYCH-UH	2213	Motivation and Volition	The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition.

1101	1101	PSYCH-UH	2216	Psychotherapy and Counselling	This course examines how psychodynamic, phenomenological, narrative, and cognitive psychology have informed therapy and counselling. Students will study how these alternative explanations for the mind and human behavior have contributed to the creation of different kinds of therapeutic intervention. Students will also have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with fundamental communication and interpersonal skills that counsellors/therapists have to be able to apply and to learn about ethical issues that need to be taken into account when working with vulnerable individuals. Finally, the course will include a critical examination of the extent to which the different approaches to counselling are informed by empirical research and been evaluated in terms of their effectiveness.	0	0
1102	1102	PSYCH-UH	2410	Cognition	Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of the human mind and human thinking. This course is aimed at providing the student with a better understanding on how we humans perceive and think about ourselves and about the world. Our perception and thought processes are fraught with biases that nonetheless routinely inform human actions. Knowing about these biases and understanding their effects is crucial in a world in which human societies are becoming increasingly more interconnected. The course covers different aspects of attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, decision making, conscious and unconscious cognition, and theory of mind.  The course will emphasize how psychologists use experiments to learn about the structure of the human mind.	0	0

1107	1107	PSYCH-UH	3511	Visual Cognition	(Formerly PSYCH-AD 322)This course offers an introduction to how our visual system allows us to see the world. Students will learn how vision works, from the low-level and unconscious analysis of sensory signals to the generation of perceptual awareness. Students will study how other higher functions such as attention, learning and working memory contribute to our visual experience of the world. Both functional and neurophysiological models of visual processing are addressed. An introduction to signal detection theory is provided. The course covers theoretical issues about vision, in particular whether perception constitutes a direct reflection of the outside world or rather inferential processes transforming the outside world into a private subjective reality. The course also addresses how one can design psychophysics experiments to address specific questions about the architecture and mechanisms of visual cognition. Students will see how visual illusions can inform us on how our brain deals, sometimes inappropriately, with external stimulations.	0	0

1117	1117	PSYCN-UH	1000	Introduction to Linguistics	This course offers an introduction to linguistics, the scientific study of language. The focus of linguistics within the cognitive sciences is to understand how it is that humans are able to speak and understand natural language, how they acquire this ability, and how they put it to use. The ability to speak and understand language is unique to humans and universally represented within the species. Language affords us, together with other faculties of the mind, the ability to achieve levels of abstract thinking as well as social organization, a feat that is unprecedented in the animal kingdom. Language is therefore one of the most characteristic features that we have as a species, and its study is of central importance to understanding what it is to be human. This course is open to all students but will NOT count towards the Psychology major.	0	0
1118	1118	PSYCN-UH	1001J	Cognition	This course is a survey of cognitive psychology, the scientific study of the human mind and human thinking. During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. While covering the basic research that has been in done in all these areas, the course will also review evidence for the existence of cross-cultural differences in human thinking.	0	0

1139	1139	SCIEN-UH	1501:1503	Foundations of Science 5: Propagating Change	Foundations of Science 5: Propagating Change focuses on disturbances in physical and living systems that bring about change. In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.	0	0

1143	1143	SCIEN-UH	1601:1603	Foundations of Science 6: Oscillations and Uncertainties	Foundations of Science 6: Oscillations and Uncertainties examines how repetitious or cyclical events, although presumably predictable, are associated with inherent uncertainty in their outcomes. This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution . Focused disciplinary tutorials in biology, chemistry, and physics provide an opportunity for in-depth analysis and discussion of classic papers, enhanced understanding of fundamental concepts, and development of practical skill sets.

1149	1149	SOCSC-UH	1111	Markets	This course offers students an introduction to how economists look at the world and approach problems. It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.	0	0
1150	1150	SOCSC-UH	1112	Introduction to Political Thinking	This course provides an introduction to some of the primary questions in the study of politics and the theories used by political scientists to understand the world. Among other questions, students will consider why we live in nation states, why peaceful solutions can be so elusive, and why the will of majority often goes unrealized. The course focuses on individual decision makers in the world of politics (citizens, voters, legislators) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape political outcomes. The course also explores how political institutions, such as electoral rules or the design of legislatures, can structure the interactions of these actors. The course relies on cases and examples and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to illustrate how these theories of political behavior and institutions can shed light on current political events.	0	0
1151	1151	SOCSC-UH	1113	Introduction to the Study of Society	How is social order possible? How does it emerge, how is it maintained, and how does it transform? This course will approach these questions with an examination of various ways in which people form social relations, and how those relationships condition the way they act. The first part of the course is about how social roles and social status are constituted by social relations in everyday life. Second, we will study how groups and the boundaries between groups are constructed and maintained, and how group membership structures individuals’ life chances and well-being. Third, we turn we turn our focus to mechanisms - robust processes by which individual level actions cumulate into the macro-level structures in which we are embedded. Finally, we examine some of the resulting characteristics of contemporary societies, as well as how and why social change occurs.	0	0
1152	1152	SOCSC-UH	1201	Mathematics for Social Scientists II	Building on Calculus or Mathematics for Social Sciences I, this course provides a further reaching study of mathematics immediately relevant for social science majors. Beginning with a review of univariate calculus and optimization, the discussion moves to the basics of linear algebra, multivariate calculus and tools related to the constrained optimization of functions. The last set of topics includes introductions to comparative statics and discrete-time dynamic optimization. The course focuses on employing mathematics to formulate and communicate theories within the social sciences, and illustrates the usefulness of mathematical results directly in terms of applications to models of optimizing agents.	0	0
1153	1153	SOCSC-UH	1210Q	Logic of Social Inquiry	This course examines the major approaches to empirical studies in the social sciences, and studies the relationship between social questions raised and methods employed.

1155	1155	SOCSC-UH	1311	Introduction to Political Theory	In a world where interests and values often conflict, how should societies be governed? Which form of government is best? Have we reached what Francis Fukuyama famously termed ‘The End of History’ - the notion that there are no serious contenders to liberal democracy? Subjects in this course include ancient and modern theorists such as Aristotle, Machiavelli, Montesquieu, and Burke as well as contemporary Chinese critics of Western liberal democracy.	0	0
1156	1156	SOCSC-UH	2210	Introduction to Game Theory	This course introduces the basic concepts of elementary game theory in a way that allows students to use them in solving simple problems. Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner’s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.	0	0
1157	1157	SOCSC-UH	2211	Survey Research	This course will teach students how to design and implement a survey, and what to do once the data is in. The course is practice oriented: the course will use a lot of examples and students will create their own survey design. Students will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course students will be able to design and implement their own, high quality survey. Moreover, students will question much of the data that is collected by others because they know all the things that can go wrong in the process.	0	0
1158	1158	SOCSC-UH	2212	Research Design & Causality in Social Science	This course will provide students with the “foundations” to undertake research in social science. You will learn how to identify an interesting research question. You will be introduced to different approaches that social scientists take to answer these questions. And because many of the questions we are interested in are causal (What leads to Y? What is the impact of X?), you will learn about different strategies to get at causality. We will also discuss other key issues related to good research like transparency and ethics. This class is hands on. During the course you will create your own research design. Furthermore, we will make use of examples to critically evaluate existing research. This class is highly recommended to students who plan to write a capstone or a research paper.	0	0
1159	1159	SOCSC-UH	2213	Textual Analysis for the Social Sciences	The computational analysis of large amounts of written material is becoming increasingly popular in the social sciences. Recent research has used textual analysis to examine, for example, attitudes, culture, and propaganda. This approach, however, raises many questions. What are textual data actually showing us? How representative are textual datasets? Does textual analysis provide insight into social mechanisms and causal processes? This course will address these, and related, questions by providing a foundational introduction to textual analysis for the social sciences. Students will read a combination of early, theory-oriented articles and recent, cutting-edge research. In addition, students will learn how to conduct textual analysis for the social sciences through a series of labs and an original final project.	0	0
1160	1160	SOCSC-UH	3210	Advanced Game Theory	This course continues the study of game theory and its applications to the social sciences. The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.	0	0
1161	1161	SOCSC-UH	3220	Econometrics	Application of statistics and economic theory to problems of formulating and estimating models of economic behavior. Matrix algebra is developed as the main tool of analysis in regression.  Acquaints students with basic estimation theory and techniques in the regression framework and covers extensions such as specification error tests, heteroscedasticity, errors in variables, and simple time series models. An introduction to simultaneous equation modes and the concept of identification is also provided.	0	0
1162	1162	SOCSC-UH	3221EJ	Experimental Research in the Social Sciences	This course offers an accessible introduction to the new approach of “lab-in-the-field” experiments; in which researchers use laboratory methods to study human, social, economic, and political behavior with nontraditional (nonstudent, nonwestern) subjects. We will work with researchers at the lab established at the FLAME University, Pune India, a special partnership between FLAME and Nuffield College, Oxford. We will meet the researchers from FLAME in Goa, India. As part of the visit, we will learn about the experiments that have been conducted in India as well as see other cultural sights in the region. Students will have a chance to meet fellow students and researchers at the Centre and share their own experimental design with them and, ideally, participate in conducting an experiment with researchers from the laboratory. At the conclusion of the class, students will be able to participate in a special international three-day workshop on experiments in social sciences, jointly organized with Professor Amaney Jamal of Princeton University. Note that an A- or better grade in this course satisfies the course requirement for using the Social Science Experimental Laboratory at NY.	0	0
1163	1163	SRPP-UH	1410	Revolutions and Social Change	(Formerly SRPP-AD 116)Revolutions mean purposive and contentious efforts to re-engineer whole societies according to the visions of justice and progress. What social theories better explain these exuberant, extraordinary events? How did the revolutionaries, their strategies, and programs evolve during the modern epoch? What typically happened after taking power? Why are there so many wars and revolutionary dictatorships? This course introduces the recent theoretical advances in understanding contentious mass politics in relation to the formation of modern states, democratization, socialism, and nationalism. Empirical examples include: the American Independence of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789; the communist revolutions in Russia and China; the anti-colonial movements of the 20th century in India, South Africa and Cuba; and the youth revolts of 1968 in the West, 1979 in Iran, 1989 in the Soviet bloc, and the newest rebellions of the 2010s in the Middle East.	0	0
1164	1164	SRPP-UH	1411J	Race and Ethnicity in Comparative Perspective	This course explores the concepts of race and ethnicity both in international comparative perspective, and with a special focus on their meaning and manifestations in Western Europe.  Race and ethnicity are both ways of classifying human groups that arise under certain historical circumstances, with race in particular emerging in the contexts of imperialism and slavery.  Students will consider how migration, state policies, and economic organization shape the classification and characterization of racial and ethnic groups.  With Italy as an important site to be explored, students will also learn and apply social scientific methods like ethnography and content analysis in order to gauge stratification, prejudice and discrimination in diverse areas of social life.	0	0
1165	1165	SRPP-UH	1412J	Wealth and Inequality in the Global City	Rising income and wealth inequalities in many countries around the world, combined with the very high levels of concentration of wealth in the world economy, have become a topic of growing concern for social scientists and media commentators. For example, some estimates suggest that the richest 100 people in the world control half of all of the world’s wealth, while billions of people around the globe survive are forced to survive on less than $2 a day. Our course will interrogate some of the key questions raised by rising inequality from a variety of perspectives. We will use our location in Accra as a laboratory for this investigation, taking advantage of the opportunity to both observe inequality and poverty up-close as well as exploring some of the ways in which governments and NGOs are attempting to ameliorate the worst of its effects. But we will frame our investigation in the global context: what happens in Accra is heavily shaped by larger global trends. We will ask: who is rich and who is poor, and how they are related to one another? To what extent is inequality (and even poverty) beneficial, harmful, or both to entire societies or key groups within them?	0	0
1166	1166	SRPP-UH	1413X	Social Change and Development in the Arab World	The “Arab World” is often lumped into one homogeneous category, which conceals the diversity found within this broad region. Keeping this in mind, this course will examine the unfolding of the “development project” in the postcolonial period and up to our present day in various Arab nation states. Beginning with an excerpt from the Arab Human Development Report, students will take a critical look at how development is defined and measured. Culture and religion have often been invoked as the major obstacles to development in the Arab World. This course will engage with this discourse as through exploring faces of modern day colonialism. What are the new tools and institutions of this new colonialism? How has this affected development and social struggle? The class will be organized around themes and corresponding case studies. Students will engage the idea of “development” in areas of education, economics, natural resources, women’s rights, and social welfare. Students will also examine home-grown counter movements, focusing on youth efforts of organizing.	0	0
1167	1167	SRPP-UH	1414	Social Dimensions of Health	This is an introductory-level course on social variables (e.g. social class, social networks/support, poverty, neighborhood environments, residential segregation, race/ethnicity, discrimination, housing conditions, work environments, and income inequality) that affect population health and overviews theories of disease distribution, with an emphasis on social theories including social production of disease and ecosocial theory.	0	0
1168	1168	SRPP-UH	1610J	Child Development and Social Policy in a Global Society	The overarching goals of this course are to introduce students to (1) the great variation in children’s development in 21st century global society and (2) how public (government) and private (family, non-governmental and business) sector policies affect children’s health, education and economic well-being in low-middle-and high-income countries. Students will learn how to critically examine historical trends in demography, economics and politics that influence child development; understand the role of science and of participatory/ democratic processes in increasing the effectiveness of programs and policies affecting children; and analyze political/cultural/communications challenges to improving programs and policies for children.  Each student will propose policy changes in a particular country chosen by the student that could dramatically improve the well-being of children.	0	0
1169	1169	SRPP-UH	1611	Introduction to Global Health	Despite the significant progress made towards achieving globally set targets for health in some countries, others - particularly in sub-Saharan Africa - are falling behind. This course introduces students to the main concepts of the public health field and the critical links between global health and social and economic development. Lectures explore major themes in global health, including the social determinants of health, the global distribution of disease burden and risk factors, key measures to address the disease burden in cost-effective ways, and the role of health systems and diverse global actors in responding to the health needs of populations worldwide. The course is global in coverage, but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries and on the health of the poor.	0	0
1170	1170	SRPP-UH	1612	Global Health and Economic Development	This course examines the relationships among poverty, disease, health and development. The class will consider the role of health in the context of socio-economic development and the Millennium Development Goals, and will explore where health falls among competing social service and development priorities. Students will discuss the promotion of pro-poor health policies and healthcare investments as a strategy to achieve poverty reduction and economic growth. The course will examine the practical constraints and challenges of fragile healthcare systems, and lessons from the experience of countries at different stages of economic development.	0	0
1171	1171	SRPP-UH	1613J	21st-Century International Human Rights	This course is designed to give an introduction to the law, policy, philosophy, institutions, and practice of modern international human rights. Human rights have a history that is national, regional, and international. Part I of the course presents an overview of the theory, history, and legal frameworks of the international human rights movement. Part II will explore these themes through the lens of the Argentinian experience. Students will study human rights violations during the Dirty War and national and international responses that sought to expose abuses, marshal human rights institutions to take action against them. This course also will examine efforts within Argentina over the last 30 years to balance reconciliation and accountability for past abuses. In Part III, this course will examine current human rights challenges facing governments, civil society groups, international organizations, and businesses today. The course will include field trips around Buenos Aires and guest speakers with direct experience in the human rights movement in Argentina.	0	0
1172	1172	SRPP-UH	1614	Entrepreneurship	Whether as heroes or agents of creative destruction, entrepreneurs and their innovations have had a transformative influence on modern economic growth and the wealth of nations. The first part of the seminar introduces the classical and contemporary writings on the rise of entrepreneurial capitalism in the West and the global diffusion of modern entrepreneurial spirit and firm. Classical approaches pioneered the study of modern entrepreneurship in its rational orientation to profit making through innovative activity. Contemporary approaches shift the emphasis away from analysis of individual attributes and agency to focus on examining the role of social networks, organizational forms, and institutional environment in facilitating entrepreneurial activity. The last part of the seminar will focus on research on entrepreneurship using secondary sources and data available through the internet.	0	0
1173	1173	SRPP-UH	1615	Law, Society, and Public Policy	This course offers sociological perspectives on law and legal institutions: the meaning and complexity of legal issues; the relation between law and social change; the effects of law; uses of law to overcome social disadvantage. Topics included in this course are: limits of law; legal disputes and the courts; regulation; comparative legal systems; legal education; organization.	0	0
1174	1174	SRPP-UH	1616J	Children, Youth and Sustainable Development of the World's Cities	Goal 11 of the 2015-2030 global Sustainable Development Goals is new on the global development agenda and focuses on cities and human settlements (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable). The goal reflects the global demographic shift towards urban residence (over half of the world's population now lives in cities). This course will consider innovations from around the world in making cities sustainable for children and youth, who represent the future of sustainable societies.  In addition, urban innovations for sustainability will be reviewed.  Fieldwork abroad will provide opportunities for the observation of programs as well as meetings with NGO staff, youth and other urban leaders, and will supplement the readings and discussions. Topics covered will include supporting youth livelihoods, learning and health programs, arts programs, infrastructure investments, environmental sustainability, transportation, migrant-origin youth, governance and innovation.	0	0
1175	1175	SRPP-UH	1617	Sociology of Entrepreneurship	Entrepreneurship is the principal source of economic development, technological innovation, and creation of wealth and jobs in market economies. This course is concern with entrepreneurship, with a special emphasis on the recent work by sociologists and sociologically-oriented organizational theorist that investigates central questions in entrepreneurship. Throughout the semester, we will understand various ways in which the social sciences have provided theoretical insights into entrepreneurial behavior in its broader social, institutional, technological and cross-national contexts. Furthermore, we will also understand entrepreneurship from more practical view by utilizing case studies. Additionally, we will explore timely important topics related to entrepreneurship, and identify sources of data / information during the last few classes.	0	0
1176	1176	SRPP-UH	1618J	Political Abdications	Why do groups renounce their capacity to act? Why for instance did the United States Congress relinquish its constitutional right to declare war to the benefit of President Bush in October 2002? How can we explain that unions, parties and civic associations fail to engage in collective action when faced with policies directly threatening their interests and survival? Whether they are explicit or not, abdications punctuate and structure the realm of politics. They condition power relationships, patterns of inequalities and regime change. This course will gauge the significance and the scope of abdication in politics, review possible explanations, investigate paradigmatic cases (e.g., August 1789 in France, March 1933 in Germany, November 1976 in Spain, 1989 in Eastern Europe), and draw the implications of this analysis for our understanding of group behavior and decision-making.	0	0
1177	1177	SRPP-UH	1810X	Islam and Society	In this seminar, students will come to understand the diverse and dynamic roles that religious and cultural Islam can play in contemporary societies, especially those in the “Middle East” and North Africa. After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student will be expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.	0	0
1178	1178	SRPP-UH	1811	Discipline	What could a European Medieval bestseller have to do with contemporary American 12-Step programs? What might link a Benedictine monk and a player on the University of Alabama football team? What is the connection between playing a Bach fugue and ice-skating?  The critical relationship between these unlikely pairs can be examined through the notion of discipline. This course will begin with an introduction to the general concept of ‘discipline’, and will continue according to a set of subtypes of discipline (spiritual; aesthetic; martial; organizational; industrial; iterative). These subtypes will be examined using historical and ethnographic evidence, short weekly readings, and by you performing your own ethnographic observation. By exploring the origins, techniques, and results of discipline in practice, we may better understand the ways in which society operates. The purpose of the seminar will be to identify and examine the set of practices that seem to lead to orderly, disciplined, behavior.	0	0
1179	1179	SRPP-UH	1812J	Sociology of Morality: Good, Evil, Altruism, and Norms	This class will examine morality and immorality from a sociological perspective. Why do people disagree about what counts as morally good and bad, right and wrong, admirable and despicable? Under what conditions are people more likely to behave altruistically and cooperatively? Under what conditions are immorality and evil more likely? The sociology of morality investigates people’s moral understandings, moral and immoral behavior, and societies’ moral institutions and norms. Unlike philosophers and ethicists, sociologists don’t try to answer moral questions. Rather, they conduct empirical research about individuals’, groups’, and societies’ morals. This class has a reading-and-analysis component and a hands-on research component. Students will read and discuss social scientific works on morality, altruism, cooperation, evil, moral institutions, and norms. Further, they’ll develop their own research projects about morality and collect their own observational data in Berlin.	0	0
1180	1180	SRPP-UH	1813X	Family and Gender in the Arab World: Continuity and Change	Social scientists have in the past described family structures and gender roles in the Arab World as based on relatively uniform and unchanging principles. However, during the last two decades many Arab societies have been subject to tremendous changes. In this course we will examine how in the social sciences the “classical” Arab family along with its underlying kinship systems and gender orders has been conceived; and how modern developments, such as urbanization, women’s education, work migration, war and exile, assisted reproduction, genetic counseling programs, TV serials, etc., are contributing to the emergence of new forms of family and gender. Also, we shall scrutinize the societal challenges brought about by these developments, such as the economic hardships of young couples, the erosion of “traditional” support networks for elderly and diseased persons, and the “neo-liberalization” of marriage. Finally, we shall take a close look at the various ways in which contemporary Arab men and women define, negotiate, and legitimate their gender identities by drawing on Islamic values, traditional ideas and practices as well as national and transnational discourses.	0	0
1181	1181	SRPP-UH	1814J	Language, Religion and Ethnicity	What is language? Where is language? What is religion? What is ethnicity? And above all, what is the connection between them? The seminar offers a linguistic view of religion and ethnicity and looks into the sociolinguistic history, society, and culture of the United States as well as the Arab world. We will consider the great diversity of communicative systems we encounter both as a source of enrichment for individuals and the nation as a whole, and as a basis for problems, and will consider possible resolutions of these problems. In addition, we will study the universal phenomenon of language change and how it affects our understanding of language behavior religiously and ethnically. Students will be introduced to basic concepts of linguistics with an emphasis on descriptive linguistics and sociolinguistics. Students will be exposed to sociolinguistic methods to examine the relationship between language and religion, language and nationalism, language and power, language and ethnicity, language and gender, and language and education. In the course we will use some interesting pockets of language use in the UAE as an opportunity to conduct field study.	0	0
1182	1182	SRPP-UH	1815J	Diversity, Inclusion and Tolerance?: Contemplations on 21st Century Identity Formation	This course will delve into the definitions, histories and emerging theories of “diversity”, “otherness”, “difference”, “tolerance” and identity formation (national, local, personal). Recently new laws and regulations in Europe have emerged, as well new “diversity” pledges in the US - it is argued that key to our global futures is “diversification”, but what does this mean?  What/Who “counts” as “diverse”, “different”? NYU Abu Dhabi is one of the most “diverse campuses” in the world? What might we learn, or how might this be important in higher education? How might competing notions of “diversity” and “tolerance” exist simultaneously and how might “diversity” be imagined in different national contexts? During the course, we will read and explore a variety of materials from different intellectual traditions including, but not limited to the work of philosophers, cultural anthropologists, political scientists, historians, artists, sociologists, and economists who have given consideration to both the conceptual questions posed, as well as the practical implications. Finally, we will consider the connections to the commitment to the Charter for Toleration in the UAE.	0	0
1183	1183	SRPP-UH	2211	Ethnographic Field Research	The course offers a practical introduction to the theoretical and methodological issues of ethnographic field research. The course offers students hands-on experience to carry out ethnographic field research, conduct in-depth interviews and carry out participant observations.	0	0
1184	1184	SRPP-UH	2213J	Sports & Society	Why do sports occupy a central place in nearly every society, ancient and modern? How might sports reflect, reveal, or shape major social, economic, and political values or changes? Why are sports so frequently politicized by governments or partisan factions? Can data generated from sporting events test social or political theories? This course examines a growing body of research on such questions to see why and how scholars have come to view sports as a venue where social, economic, and political debates and values are played out. In its first part, the course uses a variety of case studies to explore how sports (from local contests to international games) can offer a lens on the study of society and politics. The second part puts sports data to use in testing social and psychological theories of identity, trust, and prejudice, among others. In addition to reading material from several disciplines and cultural contexts, students will have the opportunity to meet UAE hosts and organizers of the recent Special Olympics games and Asian Cup football tournament in order to learn more about these events’ potential social and diplomatic impacts as well as learning about traditional regional sports such as endurance horse racing.	0	0
1185	1185	SRPP-UH	2214	Interview Methods	This course serves as an introduction to qualitative research methods with a focus on interviewing. Students will discuss a range of interview-based research methods. In qualitative research, researchers often have a significant impact on the lives of study participants and are in turn changed by the experience of fieldwork.  This carries with it some weighty responsibilities and introduces unique issues of ethics and data interpretation.  Students will deal systematically with these issues and with the procedures of research design, transcribing interviews, coding and analyzing data, and finally writing up the research in a coherent paper. Students will have extensive opportunity to learn through doing. One goal of the course is to get students to practice and hone their craft.	0	0
1186	1186	SRPP-UH	2410Q	Gender and Society	In every society, whether one is born male or female affects how one is expected to behave and the opportunities one confronts. However, how gender is organized varies between societies and across time. This course draws upon research from sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology to examine gender, providing information on how gender is organized in various parts of the world. Topics include how male and female children are socialized, women’s and men’s roles in the family, trends in women’s education and employment, the sex gap in pay, and how gender is affected by public policies.	0	0
1187	1187	SRPP-UH	2411	Wealth and Inequality	The course offers an overview of the causes and consequences of social inequality. Topics in this course include: the concepts, theories, and measures of inequality; race, gender, and other caste systems; social mobility and social change; institutional support for stratification, including family, schooling, and work; political power and role of elites; and comparative patterns of inequality, including capitalist, socialist, and post-socialist societies.	0	0
1188	1188	SRPP-UH	2412X	Islamist Social Movements in the Middle East	This course critically examines theories and case studies of religious social movements with a special focus on Islamist social movements in the Middle East. The course will begin by introducing students to the theories of social movements, highlighting the different repertoires movements adopt based on the political and cultural contexts in which they are embedded. It will then move on to exploring the role of Islam in local and global social movements. The course will turn to empirical cases of Islamist movements, analyzing their characteristics in relation to topics such as nationalism, colonialism, human rights, inequality, civil society, Sufism, and the role of women. Students will compare Islamist movements from a wide variety of countries in the region, including Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Lebanon, Palestine, Saudi Arabia as well as transnational and jihadi movements. The class will end with a discussion of the popular upheavals in the region commonly referred to under the rubric of the Arab Spring.	0	0
1189	1189	SRPP-UH	2413J	Connecting Neighborhoods and Health: An Introduction to Spatial Epidemiology	This course will focus on Spatial Epidemiology, i.e. the spatial distribution and spatial determinants of health and well being in human populations across the globe. The course will provide students with a historical, theoretical and methodological overview of the field of Spatial Epidemiology from a cross-national perspective. This is an introductory-level course; as such, the course intentionally is broad, covering a range of issues and topics (e.g. neighborhood characteristic assessment methods, methods to examine neighborhood boundaries, identification of spatial clusters [“hot spots”] of disease, quantitative methods to evaluate connections between neighborhoods and health, and connecting neighborhoods to health disparities). The course will consist of readings, group discussion, and individual inquiry, to examine the influence of neighborhood factors in health in different geographic contexts. Over the course all students will propose an original research project designed to answer a specific research question connecting neighborhoods and health. This proposal will be your final project for the course and you will present that research to the class.	0	0
1190	1190	SRPP-UH	2414	Family Change and Social Inequality	(Formerly SRPP-AD 144)Family as a social institution has kept changing across time and space. People from different family backgrounds experience diverse family lives. The diversity in family experiences is not only the consequence of social inequality but also reproduces social inequality in various domains and across generations. Social inequality may even occur within families—with spouses, parent-child, siblings and other relatives possessing interests potentially in conflict with each other. This course will examine these issues in both public and private spheres: the interaction and often tension between public policy and personal decisions, between tradition and modernity, and between morality and individual freedom.	0	0
1191	1191	SRPP-UH	2416X	Gulf Urban Societies	The spectacular development of Gulf cities in the second half of the 20th century was accompanied by great demographic and social change. This course, conceived as an introduction to the field of Gulf studies, explores the transformations of Gulf urban societies in the modern and contemporary periods, as well as their social, political, and economic outcomes. Departing from dominant paradigms such as the rentier state theory, we will rely on social history and anthropology in order to explore these processes at the level of urban societies themselves. We will first probe the materiality of Gulf cities, exploring the power relations which govern the production of space, from the role of State-mandated experts in urban planning to the multiple appropriations of urban space by city-dwellers. We will then turn our attention to the diversity of populations resulting from historical and contemporary migrations to the Gulf, looking at the complex questions they raise in terms of belonging and citizenship. From there, we will examine how social change has affected relations between generations and gendered roles, and how these are embodied in daily urban life through language or clothes.	0	0
1192	1192	SRPP-UH	2417	Global Stratification	The acute prevalence of stratification and inequality in contemporary industrial societies presents a particularly pertinent puzzle for social science researchers. On the one hand, there is the expectation that the vestiges of a post-Enlightenment heritage will offer these developed societies the framework to construct a truly egalitarian social and economic order. At the same time, we are trained theoretically to confront the inevitability of stratification, especially in societies motivated by capitalism. In turn, this brings us to an academic dilemma that rests at the very cornerstone of evolved meritocracies: if stratification is inevitable, then is inequality acceptable so long as it is “fairly” achieved? This “fair” justification for inequality is pervasive and most easily accepted: and in turn, problematic. Because so much of current inequality in society can be justified, most social processes do not seem extreme or blatantly unequal until it is too late. But whether or not we recognize these individual micro-processes, inequality and stratification in the developed first world is both extreme and rising.	0	0
1193	1193	SRPP-UH	2610	Introduction to Public Policy	Public policy affects our lives in profound ways even when we are not aware of them. What we eat, how we recycle, or when we disclose personal information on the internet are all examples of choices largely determined by public policies. This course is an introduction to public policy, why it is important, and how it involves simultaneous ethical, political, and problem-solving processes. The course introduces students to the ways in which a variety of actors and institutions at the national and transnational levels interactively contribute to public policy. The course is divided into two parts. The first part provides an overview of the basic concepts underlying the public policy process and the second part provides critical perspectives on public policy-making in theory and practice.	0	0
1194	1194	SRPP-UH	2611	Social Policy	The aim of this course is to study human conditions, social arrangements, and social processes that are sites of social, political, cultural, and moral contestations in contemporary societies. They are perceived as ‘social problems’ and divide public opinion about the appropriate ways to protect society from their deleterious effects. Lectures first focus on sociological perspectives on social problems and examine the role of social structure and social processes in their production and reproduction. Subsequent lectures focus on exploring selected social problems such as: suicide, suicide terrorism, euthanasia, aging, genocide, incest, genomics, and religious fundamentalism. The selected social problems are examined in a global perspective, focusing on contemporary industrialized societies.	0	0
1195	1195	SRPP-UH	2612X	State Formation: The Case of the United Arab Emirates	Commonly (and wrongly) people take for granted the existence of such political and cultural units as France and Germany, or Japan and India. But in the Middle East, states and national cultures are at the same time ancient and recently created. Here the complex processes of state-formation are still current, and the United Arab Emirates, which is barely forty years old, serves as a rich and richly varied example for the comparative understanding of state-building, cultural imagination, and economic development.	0	0
1196	1196	SRPP-UH	2613	Urban Poverty and Social Policy	This course explores theoretical and empirical connections between economic development, urbanization, urban poverty and distress and state/non-state responses to urban poverty and distress. The course begins with an exploration of theoretical and conceptual perspectives on urbanization and welfare state policies, then moves on to examine illustrative cases from global north and south cities that challenge and complicate reigning theories and concepts. Students will be asked to compare and contrast historical and contemporary patterns of urban poverty across global north and south regions, with a focus on the limits and possibilities of social policies (state- and non-state-sponsored) for addressing urban distress.	0	0
1197	1197	SRPP-UH	2614X	Women and Work in the Gulf	This course critically examines how women feature in contemporary debates about employment, development, and nationalism in the context of the Gulf Cooperative Council countries. The course provides a philosophical foundation for debates about women, work, and difference based on feminist theories. Students will explore postcolonial perspectives on feminism and difference, feminist Marxist critiques of capitalism, and feminist Islamist critiques of modernity. The course provides an overview of how women in the Gulf feature in contemporary discourses as participants in “globally competitive” economies, mothers of “future generations of citizens”, and symbols of “tradition and culture”. The third part of the course addresses public policy and legal frameworks shaping women’s work, exploring how different categories of “women” are produced through public policy programs such as workforce nationalization, education policy, social policy, and the interplay of national and international laws governing domestic work, human trafficking, and domestic abuse. The course will host a number of academics, activists, and policymakers.	0	0
1198	1198	SRPP-UH	2616	Immigration, Ethnicity and Public Policy	This course exposes students to recent theories of immigration and their bearing on governmental policies toward immigrant admission and settlement. A central focus of the course is the social processes by which immigration gives rise to ethnic minorities in successive generations. Topics covered in this course include: a) immigrant entrepreneurship and its bearing on successful economic adaptation; b) immigrant transnational organizations and their impact on the development of sending countries and regions; c) the adaptation process of the second generation; d) public ideologies of immigration and their impact on governmental policy.	0	0
1199	1199	SRPP-UH	2617J	Global Burden of Non-communicable Diseases	Non-communicable diseases (NCD’s) including heart disease, obesity, depression, and dementia were thought to impact the health of more developed, affluent countries while the major health issue for low and middle-income countries was acute infectious disease. Over the last decade, NCD’s have begun to critically impact the health of most populations across the globe. This course seeks to identify a number of complex issues related to the emergence of NCD’s globally and compare the disease experience in low and middle-income countries to high-income countries. The course will identify the social determinants of NCD’s and explore the recent impact of the “epidemiologic” transition in low-income countries with emphasis on West Africa.	0	0
1200	1200	SRPP-UH	2618	Welfare States in Comparative Perspective	"How do different countries respond to the challenges of poverty and economic inequality? How do they protect workers against the risks of unemployment, accident, illness, disability and old age? This course examines social policy in both advanced post-industrial democracies and the ""Global South"". The course will consider various ways in which “welfare regimes” have been characterized and classified, particularly with regard to how welfare provision is divided up among state, market and family. The course will explore how social policies originate and change, paying attention to the role of organized interests, state institutions, and partisan politics in these processes. Lastly, the course will examine how contemporary challenges - including globalization, population aging, post-industrialism and women’s workforce participation - have pressured and transformed welfare states. In all of these areas, students will pay particular attention to gender: how social policies have been shaped by, reinforced, and redressed gender inequalities."	0	0
1201	1201	SRPP-UH	2619	Leadership and Diplomacy	What role can diplomacy play in solving contemporary problems such as violent conflicts, territorial disputes, and climate change? The course will explore this question by examining the theoretical and practical dimensions of modern diplomacy, focusing on the importance of diplomatic leadership. The course will cover the changing nature of diplomacy over the past century, while concentrating on contemporary diplomatic themes and challenges including: the changing nature of diplomacy in the 21st century; the impact of domestic politics on state diplomacy; the strengths and limits of international organizations; the emergence of influential non-state international actors; changing diplomatic practices such as the widespread use of summits, conferences, and public diplomacy; and, finally, the need for diplomatic leadership to help mediate relations between an ever-growing number of groups and states in a more complex world.	0	0
1202	1202	SRPP-UH	2620	Education and Society	Our goal is to understand the role of education in society. We will explore educational processes and educational systems and consider the following questions including: the organization of education across time and place, how they institutionalize inequality, factors that shape educational development, contributions of education to the economy, culture, and social integration. We will analyze these questions from an international, comparative perspective and discuss issues including social reproduction, the achievement gap and meritocracy. The role of ethnicity, socioeconomic class and status, gender and upbringing will inform our investigation. You will learn how to analyze and debate these issues by applying different sociological theories of education.	0	0
1203	1203	SRPP-UH	2621	Bound by Borders: Sociology of Law and Migration	This course takes a sociological view of law as it applies to international migration, as well as of its origins and effects. Specifically, it asks why migration laws differ among countries, why they take particular patterns (e.g. selection by race, skills, gender), how laws change over time, how they shape inequalities in receiving and sending countries, and how they affect people’s everyday lives. The course considers explanations of the peculiar policy making alliances that emerge around migration, and of factors that shape the success of policy proposals. The approach is to compare migration related phenomena like refuge and statelessness across countries over time.	0	0
1204	1204	SRPP-UH	2622J	Seminar in Sociogenomics	The cost of genotyping is dropping faster than Moore’s law is bringing down the price of computing power. As a result, genetic data is pouring into social scientific studies, raising old debates about genes and IQ, racial differences, criminal justice, political polarization and privacy. As it turns out, serious analysis of genes and society often yields counter-intuitive results. For example, genes matter for IQ and social class, but they often act as an engine of social mobility thanks to the mixing up that takes place through recombination. Meanwhile, genetic analysis does not reify folk racial categories but challenges them: Due to a population bottleneck coming out of Africa, a Caucasian is probably more genetically similar to Inuit than are two Ugandans 200 miles apart. This course explores this new field of sociogenomics - what the genome tells us about our collective past, present society and what the future holds in terms of genetic prediction. Abu Dhabi is an ideal site: it is a cosmopolitan hub that draws diverse immigrants; the Arabian Peninsula was the site of the great population bottleneck; and the UAE has a high rate of first-cousin marriage.	0	0
1205	1205	SRPP-UH	2623J	Cultures of Addiction: A Bio-Social View	Globally there is no consensus about the nature of addiction: is it a biological problem of neuroreceptors and genetic inheritance? A character problem of poor decision-making and impulsivity?  Or a social problem of unemployment and narcotraffic? This course strives for a multifaceted, biosocial understanding of addiction not only as a clinical problem, but also as a cultural symbol that drives global economics, law enforcement, and pharmaceutical development.  The course begins with a history of popular and scientific understandings of addiction, from 19th-century Europe, the Americas, Africa, Latin America and Asia, up to contemporary neuroscientific knowledge, before exploring critical social analysis of class, ethnicity/race, and gender in relation to addiction biotechnologies. Asking how these approaches might shape clinical practice, community interventions, and public policy, students will compare drug policies internationally, through ethnographies of addicted people living under those policies, and will conduct field interviews and observations in the National Rehabilitation Centre in Abu Dhabi, the Erada Centre for Rehabilitation in Dubai, and in a number of centers for addiction services in Kampala, Uganda. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Uganda.	0	0
1206	1206	SRPP-UH	2624JX	Disability in a Global Context: Advancing Inclusion in the UAE	The course explores the implications and meaning of having a disability in global contexts. The overarching goal is to introduce students to key issues facing persons with disabilities. Using the UAE as a case study, the course examines how public (government) and private (outside of the government) policies and practices, in the education, health, cultural, sport, transportation, social welfare, and tourism sectors, affect the inclusion of persons with disabilities. The students will also explore and identify factors, including how international trends in disability and inclusion and local cultural beliefs, influence inclusion .	0	0
1207	1207	SRPP-UH	2625JX	Making Women Matter: Case Studies from the GCC	Case Studies from the GCC:  Women’s rights have been a hypervisible feature of the development of the modern state in the GCC. For example, women’s mobility and access to work in desegregated settings in Saudi Arabia are an important and highly publicized part of its recent economic and political reform efforts. In the UAE, the Gender Balance Council was established to design policies that support women’s empowerment in coordination with the OECD and UN. How do these top-down empowerment initiatives influence the day-to-day lives of women and men in the GCC? What kinds of femininities and masculinities are reshaped and negotiated in response to these programs? How do the practices and discourses of “state feminism” and “global competitiveness” simultaneously strengthen and obscure important aspects of gender equality? In this course, we investigate how national level policies influence women’s career paths in the GCC. We explore how women’s entry into the labor market involves navigating a variety of discourses about gender, class, religion, ethnicity, citizenship, and other context specific intersectional identities. We also unpack how and why women’s employment became a feature of the state’s ability to signal modernity and competitiveness in the global arena.  We engage with academics, government officials, writers, activists, and artists involved in state-led women’s empowerment initiatives in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Riyadh. Topics of discussion include: employment, entrepreneurship, mobility, micro-enterprise, personal status laws, as well as, the role of art and culture.	0	0
1208	1208	SRPP-UH	2626J	Knowledge Translation: Bridging Science, Policy, and Practice in Inclusive Education	How do we apply research evidence? Knowledge translation (KT) is a bridge between research, policy, and practice in an effort to strengthen public service sectors and improve outcomes. Essentially, KT is an interactive process involving exchanges between researchers who create new knowledge and those who use it. The focus of this course will be on the theory and application of knowledge translation with the goal of promoting evidence-based policy, practice, and research utilization. This course examines (1) the theory, science, and practice of KT, (2) how to assess and prioritize KT strategies, and (3) how to create knowledge products. Using data generated from Professor Njelesani’s research study on inclusive education in Zambia, students will develop culturally and contextually appropriate KT products (e.g., policy briefs, scientific abstracts and posters, website content, infographics, visual art, digital storytelling, etc.) based on the needs of multiple stakeholders (e.g., education and disability policymakers, researchers, educators, disabled persons’ organizations, and persons with disabilities) to disseminate knowledge and improve research uptake. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to Zambia.	0	0
1209	1209	SRPP-UH	2627	Organizations and Society	Where do organizations come from? What do they have in common? How does an organization make a decision? Why do organizations change or fail to change? What are the differences in organizations from 1980s and from 2010s?   This course tries to understand the organizational dynamics in modern society by learning the different type of organizations (from a distinctively modern form of social organization to contemporary organizations, project teams and groups) and organizational systems. It is primarily an organization theory class but it will provide participants different analytic lens to read organizational cases (i.e., firms, non-profits, governments, or temporary orgs). Readings and lectures will present different theoretical paradigms developed from the classics till the recent ones about how sociologists or organization theorists analyze organizations, often with contrasting assumptions and conclusions. Participants will be examining key topics of macro organizational theories in order to understand contemporary organizations with different emphases and implications.	0	0
1210	1210	SRPP-UH	3210	Practicum in Social Research	Strongly recommended for 3rd year SRPP majors. This course will give students hands-on experience developing a full research proposal with an emphasis on analytical design. The research proposal may serve as the basis for capstone projects. Students will identify key questions, common arguments, and quantitative and qualitative sources of evidence for which they will develop proficiency in a range of analytic tools, including new computational analysis approaches.	0	0
1211	1211	SRPP-UH	3214	Social Networks	Social networks are the subject of some of the most exciting recent advances in the natural and social sciences. This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (‘tipping points’), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, inter-organizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.	0	0
1212	1212	SRPP-UH	3215	Quantitative Data Analysis	This course covers how to analyze data and test theory from a practical perspective. The course begins with techniques for describing data and then moves to the basics of linear regression, a technique that allows researchers to ask how two variables are related to one another while controlling for other variables. The course explores how regression works as well as things that can go wrong with regression, examining diagnostics, errors and collinearity. The course also examines regression models for some special cases, such as yes/no dependent variables and special cases of data that are clustered, such as students located within the same schools. The course focuses on the interpretation of results, with particular emphasis on visualization to aid understanding of complex statistical models and nonlinear relationships.	0	0
1213	1213	SRPP-UH	3410	Social Science Analysis of Global News	How does one ‘read the news’? It might be trickier than it sounds. The construction of what becomes ‘news’, its dissemination and interpretation are complex and inherently contentious social processes. Finding your way in the realm of mass communication, propagandistic conflicts, and public debate requires both theoretical lenses and good practical skills which this course intends to supply.	0	0
1214	1214	SRPP-UH	3412	Issues in African Societies	In the broadest terms, the course's objective is to introduce students to some of the contemporary issues in Africa. These issues will be studied using a historical and sociological perspective. Following an introductory overview, part one of the course examines the scramble for Africa, colonialism and the legacies of colonialism, and the fights for independence. Part two of the course looks at growth, development, and corruption in Africa. The impact of foreign aid on development will be examined. In part three, the class shall explore cultural transformations coming out of Africa. The class will discuss the links between migration and development and African migration and incorporation in diasporas in the Global North. A major theme will be placing African societies in a global context, and throughout the course, the professor will use the continent to illustrate the costs and benefits of globalization for countries in the Global South.	0	0
1215	1215	SRPP-UH	3610	Public Policy Analysis: Case studies for Effective Formation and Implementation	This course is an intermediate public policy class. Students will   build on skills introduced at the intro level such as the drafting of public policy press releases; and how to best frame policy challenges to explain proposed solutions and defend policy decisions. In addition, students will be asked to compile full dossiers on specific public policy issues to allow for policy makers to knowledgeably make effective decisions. Students will learn wider theoretical frames and debates as well as crisis management. The course will cover a wide range of global policy challenges revolving around issues such as immigration, the climate crisis, food quality and security using current case studies. Finally, students will explore the politics of policy-making and learn how to maneuver in a competitive policy environment. Select speakers will share challenges and opportunities that they have encountered in the field based on the case studies that will be explored during the course.	0	0
1216	1216	SRPP-UH	3810	Topics in Contemporary Theory	An overview of developments in social theory since the 1950s. Theories considered include structural functionalism, hermeneutical approaches, interactionist and phenomenological perspectives, rational choice, network theory, the new institutionalism, and theories of globalization.	0	0
1217	1217	SRPP-UH	4000	Capstone Seminar	During this yearlong course, students develop a research question and design and analyze quantitative or qualitative data sets relevant to public policy.	0	0

1219	1219	THEAT-UH	1010	Making Theater	Working as a performance company, students learn the fundamentals of collaborative theater making. Acting and performance are central to the process, but so is the recognition that a performance takes place in a space that has to be invested with rules and conventions before it can tell a story. Exploring the possibilities offered by these rules and conventions is key to understanding the potential for theater as a means of expression and mode of knowledge. Combining the tools and techniques of Aristotle, Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Brecht, Grotowski, Brook, and Bogart, students work in groups to devise and stage silent stories as well as textual scenes to explore what it means to create a theatrical experience. All students participate as directors, actors, designers, and audience, and discuss each other’s work in order to develop a clearer and more objective relationship to their own.	0	0
1220	1220	THEAT-UH	1011	Thinking Theater	This course offers a survey of theater in the modern and contemporary era exploring its aesthetic, social and cultural dimensions. Thinking theater from an intercultural and interdisciplinary perspective allows for the critical exploration of a plurality of practices and discourses while questioning the role of the artist, the place of the spectator as well as the very nature of the theatrical event and the ethics of representation. The aim of this course is to give students a solid knowledge of theatre, performance practices and major theoretical frameworks, while focusing on the distinct geopolitical conditions in which these practices and theories are situated. Students engage with the work of artists such as Ariane Mnouchkine, William Kentridge, Werewere Liking, Faustin Linyekula, Lola Arias, Bruce Gladwin, Laila Soliman, Omar Abusaada and Mohammad Al Attar.  Through screenings, readings of plays, artists’ talks, live performances and critical texts in theatre, art history, literature and postcolonial theory, this course aspires to create an analytical and critical platform for thinking theatre as a collaborative process of creation within and beyond the limits of the stage, at the intersection of aesthetics and social practices.	0	0

1222	1222	THEAT-UH	1110	Fundamentals of Acting	Students begin to build a performance vocabulary by using a range of techniques for translating the actor’s imagination into stage action. Students are introduced to the internal and external demands of turning creative impulse into behavior, and explore acting fundamentals such as exploring text by connecting it to physical action; responding fully to one’s acting partner; personalizing fictional material; and exploring the role of actor-as-creator via games, improvisations, and exercises; scene work; ensemble techniques; and solo performance.	0	0
1223	1223	THEAT-UH	1111	Creating Original Work	This class explores devising as a means of innovating both process and form. Students will research and experiment with historical approaches to the devised process, while also building their own short-form performance projects in order to: gain insight into the nature of a process journey; develop a more intimate understanding of their own identities as creative problem-solvers; learn how to constructively engage critical conversations about work that is still in process; gain experience in the use of creative process as a form of research.	0	0
1224	1224	THEAT-UH	1112	Fundamentals of Playwriting	This course introduces students to the art and craft of playwriting by drawing from Eastern, Western, Middle Eastern and African traditions. The course engages students in a rigorous study of form, content, structure and philosophy in order to arrive at a methodology that each writer can adapt and develop in order to write plays that are ambitious in terms of the ideas and forms they deal with.  The main objectives are: to develop one’s voice as a playwright; to develop tools and techniques to realize that voice; to write a one act play.	0	0
1225	1225	THEAT-UH	1114J	"""Under the Radar"" at The Public Theater"	This course focuses on attending Under the Radar (UTR), the leading international experimental theatre festival that takes place in NYC in January. Under the Radar Festival (UTR) in Greenwich Village in New York City, an intercultural and global city, has presented some 229 theatre companies from 42 countries since its first season in 2005. The “trippy, unsettling, and affectionate” (Green) experimental festival with its budget of approximately $500,000 is one of the most important festivals in the United States for contemporary artists. The three components of the festival programming Joe’s Pub, Incoming, and the works that fall under the title Under the Radar challenge conventional theatre and performance by aiming to present the most significant aesthetic and political work of the moment. Under the Radar is housed in New York’s most prominent downtown theatrical institution, the Public Theater, which has its own traditions and prestige. Under the Radar has a different axis of aesthetics that nevertheless shares the Public’s longstanding mission to support a diverse range of contemporary work.	0	0
1226	1226	THEAT-UH	1120	Body at Work: Movement for the Artist	A voice and movement course for actors, musicians, and visual artists. Students will engage the body as an expressive tool in support of artistic craft and technique and build confidence in the ability to translate creative impulses through physical action. The course guides the student through awareness of and release from habitual tensions and into body alignment, breathing, resonators, sound and movement, group interaction, and the exploration of individual and group creativity. Class will focus on the kinetic application of movement in the art-making process, using core energy, dynamics, breath connection, strength, flexibility, range of motion, stamina, and relaxation techniques in order to strengthen our creative output. The goal is a free voice in a free body and the ability to express thought and emotion with openness and truth.	0	0
1227	1227	THEAT-UH	1121	Collaborative Art: Fundamentals of Stage Design and Production	In this course students learn to create visceral, theatrical experiences that tell clear stories through deep investigation of what comprises aesthetic experience and the fundamental tenants of design and stage composition. Students will acquire tools to: identify, externalize, and develop aesthetic impulses; actualize the world of a text through simple, powerful choices; facilitate collaborations with a design team; synthesize script analysis and point of view with rich, textured design worlds; develop an empathetic imagination; and build work with generosity toward the audience’s experience.	0	0
1228	1228	THEAT-UH	1122	Voice, Speech, and Text	Students learn the fundamentals of voice, vocal production, and vocal expression. The course is designed to help students discover their vocal potential, to reduce obstructive physical habits and tensions and to move towards free, full-range voices. This course is built to cultivate vocal-physical development and sensorial acuteness. Students will begin to understand, in themselves, the connection between thought/impulse/idea, voice, communication and audience.	0	0
1229	1229	THEAT-UH	1123	Unmasking the Actor	Unmasking the Actor is a course based on the performance philosophy and practice of Jacques Lecoq, in which an investigation of the mechanics of the body is applied to dramatic creation on different acting traditions. Students analyze their body and movement with four different kinds of mask: Neutral mask, Larval mask, Commedia dell’Arte mask and the smallest mask in the world, the red nose of the clown. In this process, the disguise drives the students to discover emotions, movements and thoughts far from their habitual and comfortable modes; by gradually removing the disguise, they reach self-awareness and learn how to enjoy their presence on stage. Combining the methodologies of Jacques Lecoq, Carlo Boso and Philippe Gaulier the course guides students through analysis of stage performance and its effects.	0	0

1231	1231	THEAT-UH	1125J	Dramaturgy of Disruption	Engaging Theater as an inherently physical and interdisciplinary art form, this course disrupts traditional modes of storytelling, collaboration, and theater making. Framing dramaturgy as the consideration of structures and their impacts, the course investigates a range of dramaturgical approaches for rehearsal, collaboration, architecture, space, and performance. In doing so, we will look at dramaturgies across art forms and geographies and land them in theater practice. Furthermore, this course engages students in a detailed approach of Theater Mitu’s training methodology of Whole Theater. This demanding physical training will lay the foundational discipline to garner successful models of artistic, explorative, and creative dramaturgies. Ultimately this class proposes disruption as a means towards innovation and a richer understanding of what it is to be an artist and a human. NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students. This course includes a required international trip to India.	0	0
1232	1232	THEAT-UH	1510X	Theater in the Arab World	This class examines recent trends in contemporary Arab theatre, contextualizing these within a broader history of Arab performance including film. Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus’s Historical Miniatures, ‘Udwan’s The Trial of the Man Who Didn’t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus’s The Elephant, Diyab’s Strangers Don’t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki’s use of the halqa and Wannus’ inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus’s and Farag’s use of the Arabian Nights tales, Al-Hakim’s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim’s use of Greek myth).	0	0
1233	1233	THEAT-UH	1512	Representing the Real	This course examines how theatrical simulations of reality from the mid-20th century until now inform our understanding of the world in which we live. Particular attention is given to how theater artists and theorists have tried to intervene in the course of history by constructing their own version of events. Course reading includes a wide range of plays that directly engage real events across a broad spectrum of personal, social, political and historical circumstances by using witness accounts, film footage, photographs, documents, legal transcripts, interviews, and the reality and fiction of staged objects. Students will gain an understanding of the performativity of bodies, memory, nation, terror, and the archive.	0	0
1234	1234	THEAT-UH	1513	Making the Anthropo[s]cene: Figuring Climate Change Across the Arts	(Formerly THEAT-AD 154)This course will examine the range of artistic responses—across many genres and media— to the rapidly emerging and deeply confounding phenomena of climate change. Though largely human caused—so much so that scientists have proposed a new name for the current age: the Anthropocene, “Age of Man”—these phenomena are nevertheless increasingly beyond the reach of human technological solutions or predictive models; as such, they challenge us to revise our understanding of how our species relates to the non-human world around us. We will explore what artists and art criticism can learn from approaches emerging from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, philosophy of science, politics, and philosophy, and we will study a variety of literary, cinematic, visual, and pop-cultural art works, to seek our own answers to the question of art’s role in the emerging age of climate chaos.	0	0
1235	1235	THEAT-UH	1514	African Women Playwrights	This 7-week (or 14-week) reading, writing intensive course focuses on the structural and narrative diversification of dramatic texts, intended for production, written by African women. Across the 54 sovereign nations, the women’s writings unabashedly confront a range of pressing cultural, political, and personal issues: from agency, identity, tradition, education, faith, modernism, racism, and class, to sex, marriage, and the intersectionality of blackness, African-ness (and/or Arab-ness), and womanhood. The course will address these various foci through works by such dramatists as Andiah Kisia, Sitawa Muragori, Meaza Worku, Nathalie Etoke, Werewere Liking, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Dania Gurira, Fatima Gallaire, Penina Mlama, Ama Ata Aidoo, Efua Sutherland, Osonye Tess Onwueme, Julie Okoh, Sindiwe Magona, Malika Ndlovu, Gcina Mhlope, Violet Barungi, Asiimwe GKashugi, and Dalia Basiouny. The foundational critical theories are in post-colonialism and feminism, critical race theory, and diasporic studies.	0	0
1236	1236	THEAT-UH	1515	History of Community Based Performances	As cultural practices and public arts, community based performances are forged by intense collaborations between artists and specific residents and localities. Together they combine performance traditions, artistic production and reception with broad ideas of the cultural, political and social engagements within which communities seek representation and agency. This course offers a global historical overview of case studies that integrate performance aesthetics and traditions with various ideas of community and citizenship. Case studies such as Bread and Puppet, Negro Ensemble and El Teatro Campesino in the US, The Arena Theater of Sao Paulo in Brazil, Theater for Development initiatives in Africa and Asia, as well as directors Augusto Boal, Luis Valdez, Uttpal Dutta, Gloria Anzaldua, Ngugi wa Thiongo illustrate the study of community building, performance ethnography and performance of culture this course offers.	0	0
1237	1237	THEAT-UH	1516J	Experimental/Avantgarde Performance: Paris Now, New York 1960s-70s	What are the similarities and differences in experimental performances in Paris and New York? What are the theories underlying these performances? To answer these questions  we will examine both historical and contemporary performances and theories. New York: happenings, postmodern dance, environmental theatre, Richard Foreman, Robert Wilson, The Performance Group, etc. Paris: roots of the avantgarde: Alfred Jarry, Antonin Artaud, dada, surrealism, theatre of the absurd. Contemporary Paris performances: Ariane Mnouchkine/Théâtre du Soleil, Jerome Bel, Ivo van Hove, Philippe Quesne/Vivarium Studio, etc. Students will attend performances, view media, go to the Théâtre du Soleil, Centre Pompidou, and the Palais de Tokyo. Several French scholars and artists will visit the class. Schechner will point out other key Parisian cultural venues: Maison des Arts Cretail, Louvre, Musée D'Orsay, etc.	0	0
1238	1238	THEAT-UH	1517X	Arab Performance and Revolution	Anti-authoritarian uprisings spread across the Arab World in 2011, demonstrating a new willingness among Arab populations to demand change. Cultural producers - theatre and film-makers, singers, graffiti artists, and performance activists - supported the uprisings in public spaces and online. As a result, the Arab public sphere and art-making has been transformed: the boundaries of permissible speech were breached; state sanctioned venues were undermined as art-makers turned to informal venues, city spaces, and the digital public sphere. This work repeated demands for popular sovereignty - the right of the people to invalidate corrupt rule - evidenced in the rallying cry “Ash-shaʻb yurīd isqāṭ an-niẓām” (the people demand the Regime’s downfall) whether chanted in public squares, painted on walls, or incorporated into performance pieces. Increasingly, artistic work in the shadow of uprisings has explored the personal decisions informing individual revolts, decisions that not only involve resistance to political elites but family, religious, and social elites. As such, the ongoing art of the uprisings erases boundaries between the personal and political. This art expands on artist attacks on patriarchy and demands for sexual freedom that gained intensity in the Arab World at the turn of this century and continue today.	0	0
1239	1239	THEAT-UH	1518	Spectacle and Surveillance	Spectacle and surveillance have emerged as key concepts articulating the relationship between power and performance in contemporary societies. This course will interrogate these two phenomena from the perspective of theater as one of the earliest technologies for watching and being watched. We will begin with examples of spectacle and surveillance prior to the advent of electronic media, such as courtly theater in 17th century Europe and the role of eavesdropping in dramatic literature. We will then consider how the advancement of capitalism and technology further institutionalized spectacle and surveillance as modes of managing colonialism, race, gender, security, consumption, and automation. Critical literature will include works by Michel Foucault, Guy Debord, Karl Marx, Siegrief Kracauer, Konstantin Stanislavski, Susan Glenn and Amy Louise Wood, among others. The course will also examine artists that incorporate questions of surveillance and spectacle as material for their own work including the Situationists, Surveillance Camera Players, Julia Scher, Mel Chin, and Trevor Paglen, among many others.	0	0
1240	1240	THEAT-UH	1519	Installation	Installation is a hybrid genre which escapes traditional categorizations. This course approaches Installation as a methodological framework across cultural, social and geopolitical discourses in order to analyze new models of spectatorship that expand the limits of what could be identified or recognised as art: installations can be participatory or not, can involve performers or lack human presence, can be site-specific or nomadic, can intervene in urban context or taking place in nature, can be durational or limited in time.   Instead of following a genealogy of installation art, the course is structured around focal points such as theatricality, site-specificity, immersion, participation. Students engage with the work of artists such as Ilya Kabakov, Pedro Reyes, Tania Bruguera, Christoph Schlingensief, Brett Bailey, Kader Attia, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Suzanne Lacy, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Tania El  Khoury, Shilpa Gupta, Akira Takayama, Theaster Gates, Yinka Shonibare. Drawing on a wide range of theoretical texts in theater, art history, philosophy and spatial politics, this course explores the artistic, social and cultural effects of installation in the performing and visual arts.	0	0
1241	1241	THEAT-UH	1520	Dramaturgy	Coined in the 18th century by the German playwright Gotthold Lessing, dramaturgy is the examination of the coherence of historical and theoretical contexts of a play including its period, style, references, characters, and structure in relation to a specific production. Since Lessing, dramaturgy has acquired additional definitions and working methods all of which also focus on the consistency of meaning whether in the play or in the production.  Exactly what dramaturgs and how they do it, is the lynchpin of the course. Beginning with Irving Goffman’s sociological dramaturgy and its notions of the self as a product of social relations including scenes and interactions, continuing with textual dramaturgy, productiondramaturgy and dance dramaturgy the course covers the major components of contemporary dramaturgy.	0	0
1242	1242	THEAT-UH	2110	Character and Action	Students develop advanced performance skills by using techniques associated with Patsy Rodenburg, Shin’ichi Suzuki, Stanislavski, Anne Bogart, and Yoshi Oida, among others. Training exercises are used to develop kinesthetic awareness, focus, listening, character, action, creativity, imagination, and collaboration. Through a holistic approach connected to recent findings in cognitive science, students build technical craft as well as begin to remove obstructive physical, vocal and mental habits, so as to release the full potential of the responsiveness, expressivity, and presence of their actor/performer instruments: the body-mind.	0	0
1243	1243	THEAT-UH	2115	Directing	What brings a play to life? What story do you most want to tell? Who is your audience, and why? What is the collaborative environment you seek? This course explores conceptual and practical approaches to directing a play. In addition to script discovery and analysis, emphasis is placed on the development of each student’s unique and subjective point of view on the material at hand. Students will journal regularly, share work in-progress with the class, create image banks, and engage in vigorous experimentation and conversation centered around the nature and art of directing theater.	0	0
1244	1244	THEAT-UH	2511	Art, Performance, and Social Practice	How might we revise and revalue the way that dominant social and economic systems and communicative technologies structure our everyday relationships? This question drives the “social turn” in art and privileges collaborations between artists and per formers who act in the role of instigators or catalysts with the communities around them. Rejecting the artist’s traditional role as the producer of a consumable aesthetic object or theatrical performance, the social practice of art and performance proposes that collaborative engagements-activist, participatory, coauthored-must be understood and valued as art. Cooperative processes become frameworks and methodologies to understand, explore and shift the impact of political and social policy, architecture, art and performance history, urban planning, and new media. The social practice of art and performance makes encounters between members of a community who are valued as “expert participants,” and trained artists. Through social cooperation and aesthetic practice, the hope in this project is that we might construct more livable lives. Students will read recent critical theories and histories of the aesthetics and politics of the social practice of art, explore case studies of “relation al art,” and collaborate on a “living as form” project that engages with the built and social environment of the UAE.	0	0
1245	1245	THEAT-UH	3090	Capstone Seminar	In the spring semester of their third year, theater majors participate in this formal capstone seminar intended to guide rising seniors through the conceptualization of a capstone, a year-long independent artistic project of the senior’s own design, and to express that concept in the form of a polished written proposal. This seminar is an interdisciplinary arts forum where students are expected to reflect upon and articulate their projects as expressions of aesthetic theory and practice, and where they can draw upon their own scholarly and artistic experience to constructively support the work of their peers. This class will support students in acquiring the methodological tools in theater and performance necessary for the realization of their vision, and will offer strategies designed to support speaking, reflecting, writing and archiving these projects.	0	0

1249	1249	URBAN-UH	1110J	Planning Abu Dhabi	As Abu Dhabi strives to position itself as a global capital city, it is embarked on ambitious plans for urban, economic and social development. Since 2007, Plan Capital 2030 laid the foundation for a new vision with sustainability as an overarching principle. The course will introduce a full understanding of the evolution of the city, its planning history, critically examine Abu Dhabi current plans and their progress, and identify the main urban actors and the forces shaping the growth of the City. Through reading key texts in urban theories, site visits, walking tours, guest speakers, presentations and debates, students will be able to understand the complexity of city planning and development in rapidly developing cities and key challenges in comparison to other regional and global examples.	0	0
1250	1250	URBAN-UH	1112J	Metropolis: Culture, Climate, and Politics in the 21st Century City	This course provides an introduction to key themes in urban studies, focusing on a selected set of issues that are particularly relevant for New York City but important for cities throughout the world. Students will read classic and important contemporary works, including selections from great books in urban scholarship whose significance transcends any one discipline.  This course will include readings from authors such as Weber, Jacobs, Ballon, Mumford, Simmel, Sennett, Wirth, Jackson, and Sassen, as well as several case studies of emerging issues, particularly questions regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainable development, and urban inequality. This course culminates with an intensive study of how New York City can respond to the challenges posed by climate change.	0	0
1251	1251	URBAN-UH	1118J	Nature of Urban Design: a New York Perspective on Resilience	This course is an introduction to the role of urban design in global sustainability. The first step is to understand how cities affect climate and how climate affects cities by examining New York as a model. New York is a coastal city faced with the simultaneous requirement to grow its population by a million people yet to improve the quality of its civic life when climate events threaten both its urban fabric and critical infrastructure. How New York uses urban design not just to survive but to thrive is the subject of this course.  This course will introduce the people, products and processes of urban design. The city itself will frequently serve as classroom, with students exploring and recording examples of urban design through the neighborhoods they transform.	0	0
1252	1252	URBAN-UH	1119J	Urban Form of Shanghai	Shanghai has evolved markedly through key stages in the history of urban form, vestiges of which are found within the city today: an old walled “Chinese city”; tree-lined boulevards and commercial avenues of 19th and 20th century foreign settlements; and suburban development in Pudong. This class examines each key stage, combining readings with in situ urban inquiry. Readings in this course cover Chinese reflections on the city in general and Shanghai in particular, as well as urban studies classics like Lewis Mumford’s The Culture of Cities. Trips take students to historically significant cultural spaces, including the old City God Temple, Fuzhou Road Bookshops, alleyway houses, The Peace Hotel, the Great World amusement park, People’s Park, the Moganshan Road contemporary art complex, as well as nearby waterway towns that illustrate aspects of Shanghai’s history before urbanization.	0	0
1253	1253	URBAN-UH	1121J	Public Space and the Life of Cities	Public spaces play an essential role in the life of cities and their residents. Public squares and parks, streets and esplanades-these are often the signature spaces that constitute a city’s distinctive identity. They are also the settings of everyday life, mixing bowls where a city’s diverse communities interact, forums for individual as well as collective action and expression. This course explores the nature of public space in cities around the world, with attention to their physical character and design, their history, their pictorial and literary representation, and the political and social practices that activate public space. This course will explore three overarching questions. What do we mean by “public” and “public space”? What are common characteristics of public spaces and how do people use them? And why are public spaces important to city life? In addition to historical and contemporary squares and streetscapes of Europe and the Middle East, the course will draw upon case studies in Sydney as well as the hometowns of the students.	0	0
1254	1254	URBAN-UH	1122J	Contested Cities: Difference, Inequality, and the Metropolis	This course explores the ways that class, race, ethnicity, and religious difference have shaped modern western cities, with attention to the spatialization of inequality in London and the British Empire. This course is interdisciplinary, bridging past and present and combining historical and social scientific approaches to urban change. We will explore patterns of segregation and residence, the history and geography of difference, and political economy. We will discuss the role that planners, architects, investors, activists, and policymakers have played in shaping metropolitan areas over the last century, with attention to key policy debates, and planning and policy interventions involving immigration, urban redevelopment, gentrification, community control, and suburbanization.	0	0
1255	1255	VISAR-UH	1010	Foundations of Photography	This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of photography. Students will learn foundational image-making techniques with a focus on Black and White analog photography. A range of studio and darkroom tools and approaches will be explored. Students will be introduced to key artists, themes, and developments in photography and will consider the impact of photographic media on the development of art and society.	0	0
1256	1256	VISAR-UH	1011	Foundations of 2D	It can be said that drawing is to the visual arts what mathematics is to the sciences. Like mathematics drawing is a universal language. Basic visual cues function the same for all people. Notwithstanding our increased dependence on technology, marking on paper continues to be the most expedient means to express ideas for painting, sculpture, or simple things like quickly making a map for someone. The paradox is that learning to see 2-dimensionally increases one's ability to see and project ideas that also take place in 3-dimensional space and time. Inventing 2-dimensional shapes to express multi-dimensional ideas or feelings requires a high degree of abstract thinking. With this course we use drawing as a tool for understanding 2-dimensional visual perception. The drawings we make in class document the degree of our ability to see 2-dimensionally.	0	0
1257	1257	VISAR-UH	1012	Foundations of 3D	This course explores the medium of sculpture and other 3D forms through the principles of three-dimensional design and the concepts that drive developments in contemporary art. Projects may include mold making, ceramics, and the use of wood working tools, as well as the use of sculpture as costume, performance, environment, or kinetic form. Students use a variety of materials from wood and cardboard to metal, plaster, paper, cloth and found objects to expand their understanding of form and space.	0	0
1258	1258	VISAR-UH	1013	Foundations of 4D	This course offers an intensive exploration of analog and digital media. Students are introduced to aesthetic, conceptual, and historical aspects of contemporary art by interfacing with a variety of imaging, audio, and communication applications. Students work in photography, video, digital art, performance, gaming, sound, and emerging practices.	0	0
1259	1259	VISAR-UH	1110	Types of Art: From Calligraphy and Stone Carving to Digital Type	Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the 'traces' and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the UAE State Calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.	0	0

Students develop creative and collaborative design skills for problem solving. Lectures and readings address Western design history, contemporary Arabic graphic design, and cross-cultural design issues. Assignments focus on the design process from conception to distribution. Students will acquire proficiency with Adobe Creative Suite software.	0	0
1261	1261	VISAR-UH	1112	Foundations of Graphic Design	This immersive studio course combines practice and reflection through a project-based approach to graphic design. Lectures and readings address Western graphic design history and visual communication in the 20th and 21st century, and contemporary Arabic graphic design. Students are exposed to the multiple facets of visual communication and understand its importance in cross-cultural contexts. The theoretical component of the class will focus on the role of the graphic designer today, in his/her constantly shifting role as artist/problem solver/skilled executant, with readings from Munari, Shaughnessy, Spiekermann. Students will receive first-hand experience grappling with the practical issues faced by design professionals worldwide. Exercises in visual communication, creative methodologies, cross-cultural design, and branding will allow them to develop creative and collaborative design skills for problem solving. Students will develop key design skills in research, gathering, analysis, decision making, brainstorming and teamwork.	0	0
1262	1262	VISAR-UH	1113J	Designing Abu Dhabi	This course guides students through the many facets of graphic design and visual communication, with a focus on the cross-cultural visual environment of Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates. Students explore multiple aspects of visual design from aesthetics to user interfaces and usability, with special consideration of signage in Abu Dhabi. They also develop graphic designs that respond to the Abu Dhabi environment. Practical exercises that emphasize visual communication skills are central to the class. Students become familiar with the design procedures at the core of successful visual identity systems, thus developing their skills in research methodologies, data gathering, analysis, decision making, brainstorming and creative solutions, team work and monitoring. Above all, the practical aspects of the course allow NYUAD students to contribute to the emerging Abu Dhabi design style.	0	0
1263	1263	VISAR-UH	1114	Yes Logo	This immersive studio course in graphic design combines practice and reflection through a project-based approach to branding. Logos are graphic marks or emblems used by commercial enterprises, organizations and individuals to aid and promote instant public recognition. How are Logos doing today? How designers are coping with new emerging standards? How do we deal with a brand when a Favicon or screen buttons become more important than header paper? We will see how some of the most successful logos only seem to be set in stone, while in reality they constantly mutate and adapt. We also examine how and why certain logos in the last two decades have become metaphors for the worst outcomes of corporate cultures and the targets of anti-globalization activists everywhere. We investigate how and why in our Age of Brands, logos ended in the spotlight for reasons opposite to the ones they were created for. Particular emphasis will be placed on the challenges faced by contemporary designers when handling assignments outside their own cultural backgrounds: do we have what it takes to make a logo function at its best in Abu Dhabi, New York or Shanghai?	0	0
1264	1264	VISAR-UH	1115X	Arabic Typography	Arabic exists as one of the world’s most ancient and poetic languages. This course will introduce students to the rich traditions of Arabic calligraphy that date back millennia and which form the basis for many of today’s modern font types. Students will examine some of the challenges associated with applying western typographic conventions and traditions to Arabic type and will experiment with letterforms and typographic concepts as key elements of graphic communication.	0	0
1265	1265	VISAR-UH	1116J	Inside Out - When Art Reflects the Self	When Art Reflects the Self: What compels an artist to create work that might explicitly draw on the uncomfortable experiences of his/her personal life? What makes art practice such a fertile ground for this to happen on? When and where did this tradition begin? Self-reflection, self-portraiture and memoir allow us to talk about personal loss, a beautiful memory, pain or a pressing desire to forgive. It’s an art practice that thrives on uncertainty and in turn, a curiosity, that encourages us to look inside for answers. This course examines the history of self-reflective art in the forms of written, visual and performative autobiography and memoir. Students engage with texts written by those who study and research in this field. They will ‘read’ and analyze artifacts produced by those who use art-making to process and understand ‘the self.’ By imagining and making their own work, students explore first hand how art mediates the sometimes disquieting but also joyful and transformative moments in our life. Students will spend five days at a remote artist retreat at the Dana Biosphere Reserve in Jordan with visiting artists. They will reflect aspects of themselves in a final Portfolio of Self Reflection that requires they work in different artistic mediums. Members of the class will collaborate and spend time alone, planning and producing the artwork for this project.	0	0
1266	1266	VISAR-UH	2110	Projects in Photography	This course focuses on the theory and practice of constructed and staged photography. The class will be structured as a semester-long investigation in which students develop projects and make commentaries on issues of personal and/or greater social significance. Students will study and experiment with several visual communication techniques and processes with the goal of developing and refining a portfolio of work.	0	0
1267	1267	VISAR-UH	2111	Projects in Painting	(Formerly VISAR-AD 117)Painting goes back 40,000 years; see the El Castillo Caves of Spain. This history, from the Neanderthal to Modern and Post-Modern times serves as evidence of our humanity. No other art forms have an accessible history this extensive, which is why the choice to make paintings can be intimidating. However, when we reach out with that brush and touch that surface we are sharing our images with all of humanity. The intelligence of painting comes from its 2-dimensional character because it requires invention of flat abstract shapes to communicate complex, multi-dimensional ideas. For the  painter the process takes place in time as an intimate theater of action. However, in public, paintings are experienced in their simultaneity. The paradox; painting is a process that takes place in time but is experienced without time. When we connect with a painting our empathy with the artist collapses all of time into the present. There is no history.	0	0
1268	1268	VISAR-UH	2112	Interventions: Three-Dimensional Thinking	We will study the new NYUAD campus and use these public or semipublic spaces as a site to develop temporary sculptural interventions. We will begin by coming to terms with conceptualizations of sculpture since the 1960s that have led to the need to distinguish between site-dominating, site-adapted, site-specific, and site-determined approaches. We will ask how the interventions developed in class relate to the architectural, institutional, social, and cultural circumstances of the campus. What sort of public should a sculptural intervention take into account and how does this public differ from the audience at an art gallery? What qualities does public space have that are distinct from those of private space and what characterizes a semi-public space? The students will develop their proposals for interventions with the aid of photographic documentation, models, and a project description before realizing the interventions in coordination with the university administration and presenting them to the public for a limited time.	0	0
1269	1269	VISAR-UH	2113	Projects in Sculpture	Students in this class will engage in a critical discourse about the material world with an emphasis on wood-based forms, materials and fabrication tools. Students will experiment with contemporary ideas, techniques, and technologies and will be introduced to contemporary artists and designers who work with wood and wood-based materials. Students will learn historic and contemporary sculpture techniques and will experiment with digital fabrication tools including the laser cutter and CNC router. Emphasis will be placed on independent investigations and creative problem solving.	0	0
1270	1270	VISAR-UH	2114	Interdisciplinary Projects in the Visual Arts	This class for experienced students is constructed around a series of projects realized in any available media or medium. How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to “read” and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in both group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.	0	0
1271	1271	VISAR-UH	2115	Fiber Studio: Textile Practices and Projects in the Arts	"""Fiber Studio students learn and explore a range of textile practices including embroidery, sewing, quilting, crochet and knitting, and weaving. Throughout the term, students will build skills in these basic textile practices. Incorporating “textility” into other mediums is encouraged, such as mixing stitching and painting, stitching and writing, and exploring the sculptural possibilities of textile. The following concepts characterize the fiber arts and will be discussed and explored in practice: repetition, labor, hand versus machine, portability, utility, the relationship between thread and line, the binary between art and craft, and the gender of textiles. We will also explore how textile objects and practices have informed and might extend, reshape, or even render mute certain art-world terms like “minimalism,” “abstraction,” and “collage.” Representative artists and traditions include Sheila Hicks, the silk sari weavers of Kanchipurum, the al sadu weavers of the Gulf region, the Siddis quilters of the Gujarat, the quilters of Gee’s Bend Alabama, Ghada Amer, Faith Ringgold, The Institute for Figuring Crochet Coral Reef, Louise Bourgeois, Anni Albers, Emily Jacir, among others."""	0	0
1272	1272	VISAR-UH	2116	Print Studio 1	Printmaking at its most basic level involves the creation of a matrix (wood block, litho stone, etching plate, etc.), inking that matrix, and then transferring the ink onto paper. Essential to printmaking is the production of multiples and repetition. This class will introduce several printmaking media and techniques including, but not limited to: drypoint, woodcut, linocut, screenprinting and monotype. The focus will be on fine art printmaking. The technical aspects of each technique will be presented and then investigated through in-class demonstrations, readings, and slide lectures, all designed to tie the history of printmaking with hands-on learning. Success in this course depends on combining technique with strong concepts, the development of an aesthetic, and a willingness to take risks to challenge your abilities and ideas. Through group critiques you will learn to speak effectively about and to analyze your work and the work of others, questioning the decisions made in the development of the image, and assessing how successfully the technical and conceptual work together to communicate ideas.	0	0
1273	1273	VISAR-UH	2117	Sound Art	"Students in this course will produce sculptural and site-specific works of Sound Art, using sound, materials, and space as their palette. The class will focus its study on artists who primarily work with sound in gallery-based situations and the surrounding fine art discourses. While the term “Sound Art” is not as old, the practice of using sound as both material and concept in the context of gallery-based visual arts stretches back over 100 years, and comes from various artists and art movements, such as Marcel Duchamp, the Futurists, Dada, and forward to the happenings of Fluxus, the Minimalists, specifically Robert Morris, and through to the procedural art making methods of John Cage and the countless artists he influenced. We will examine the use of the term ""Sound Art"" carefully and draw our own conclusions about its utility, while exploring the use of sound to unlock sculptural, architectural, material, and conceptual potentials."	0	0
1274	1274	VISAR-UH	2119	Surface Design: Pattern making and meaning	We are all familiar with surface decoration and pattern design, irrespective of our cultural origins. In fashion, textiles, design, architecture, advertising and fine art these visual patterns of daily life both identify our different backgrounds and help share connections between them. With this in mind, the course will introduce students to surface decoration and pattern-making skills, using relevant printmaking processes and other media. Illustrated talks will reference pattern-based imagery across the fine and applied arts, exploring their application and meaning, whilst demonstrations, discussion and group presentations will help course participants develop and complete personal projects with confidence.	0	0
1275	1275	VISAR-UH	2120	Documentary Photography	This course explores the history and practice of Documentary Photography. Through lectures, seminars, and photo-based projects, students will learn to record, understand, and present narratives that shape the world in which we live. Coursework will examine and complicate divisions between fact and fiction and will help students explore and develop their own photographic narratives and convincing visual stories. Throughout, students will be asked to question the role that documentary photography can and does play in the constantly changing and endlessly photographed world around us.	0	0
1276	1276	VISAR-UH	2121	Art and Architecture: Reinventing the City	This course takes a sculptural approach to exploring and reimagining the city by looking at the existing landscape of Abu Dhabi. Students will visit public parks, streetscapes, the markets, super-blocks, the port, shopping malls, and industrial districts. We will document our observations through field notes, drawings, photography, video and sound recordings. This research will serve as a foundation for creating objects, sculptures, and installations. Students will learn to develop forms of artistic and architectural presentation and representation that reflect the urban design and development of the city. This research and artistic production will be accompanied by selected readings that address theoretical, historical and contemporary perspectives from authors and artists such as: Atelier, Bow Wow, Denise Scott Brown, Homi Baba, Dan Graham, Kevin Mitchell, Robert Venturi, Andrea Zittel.	0	0
1277	1277	VISAR-UH	2122	Projects in Mixed Media	Whether planning images, sculptures, movements, maps, or more,  drawing allows for the quick transposition of ideas. It is the foundational language of the artistic mind. Foundations in 2D explores the diverse practice of drawing across media and form, from charcoal to pencil to pastel to wet media; from figure to object to abstraction.  This investigation is for novices and advanced drafters alike. The first part of the course focuses on practicing traditional drawing approaches in class, while homework assignments allow for greater subjectivity in applying the technique. Midway through the course, concept development takes center stage, with students learning about artists who have expanded upon traditional notions of drawing and/or subverted them. We study postmodern principles and use them to analyze works of art and to guide the development of original pieces. For beginners, the class will help confront expectations about what drawing entails, allowing them to develop an emboldened drawing practice free from previous conceptions. Advanced artists’ practices will be challenged and interrupted in order to invite creative risks and new conceptual approaches, expanding their practice.	0	0
1278	1278	VISAR-UH	3111	Projects in Painting	Projects in Painting introduces students to traditional and contemporary techniques in both acrylic and oil painting. Although previous painting experience is not a requirement, this course will build upon concepts taught in the prerequisite class, Foundations of 2D (such as image transposition, basic color theory and compositional knowledge, observational drawing techniques, perspective drawing). Students will learn classical realism and its methods, like underpainting and figure/ground relationships, alongside contemporary expressive approaches featuring various painting mediums. The class will take inspiration from diverse artists and study their practices within the greater context of art and social movements. Class critiques will empower students to examine their own impulses towards style and content and develop their ability to articulate the ideas driving their artworks.	0	0
1279	1279	VISAR-UH	4000	Visual Arts Capstone Seminar	The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to produce a senior thesis project. Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical, curatorial or historical research project. Students will be issued studio space for the senior year and will be expected to produce a body of artworks and a critical reflection paper based on their capstone research topic. The capstone experience will culminate in the spring with a public exhibition and a defense before a faculty panel. Students in this course are expected to use the fall semester to research and experiment in the studio by producing a series of artworks in progress (based on their capstone topic) which will be further developed during the spring term. Students will also produce an artist statement and begin drafting their critical reflection paper which will be further developed and submitted during the spring semester. Weekly class meetings will consist of short seminars, studio sessions, group critiques and one-on-one studio visits.	0	0
1280	1280	VISAR-UH	4001	Visual Arts Capstone Project	Visual arts capstone students will work primarily with their faculty mentor during the spring semester with the goal of completing their capstone project. Students will continue working actively in the studio and will be expected to produce a body of artworks and a 10-page critical reflection paper based on their capstone research topic. The capstone project will culminate in a public exhibition and a formal critique with a faculty panel.	0	0
1281	1281	WRIT-UH	1002J	Global Discoveries and Dialogues: The Quill and the Chisel	“Global Discoveries and Dialogues” examines the case for the “universal museum” through the twin lenses of global history and global heritage management. It explores different approaches to memorialization, and considers how to strike an appropriate balance between the desire to showcase “golden ages” and the responsibility to restore silenced voices. Beginning in Abu Dhabi, both sections will meet together to discuss global cultural heritage, before visiting the Louvre Abu Dhabi. The two sections then embark upon their own individual journeys. “The Quill and the Chisel” visits Florence, where students examine Michelangelo Buonnarroti’s unparalleled influence on Renaissance architecture, art, poetry, and sculpture. In considering Michelangelo’s remarkable artistic and literary achievements, alongside those featured at the Louvre Abu Dhabi, it asks students to weigh their importance in Florentine, Renaissance, and Global history. “Histories of – and in – Greece” considers the place of suppressed Byzantine, Ottoman, Jewish, and refugee histories within “Greek history” through an exploration of a diverse group of Athenian landmarks. In doing so, it challenges students to establish criteria for determining whether these sites and their attached histories have a larger significance, “outstanding universal value,” and “importance to the collective interests of humanity.” Through the use of social media, students will collaborate extensively between the two locations to further interrogate the question of how history and memory are produced. Upon returning to Abu Dhabi, groups comprised of students from both sections will craft presentations synthesizing their on-site research, in an effort to address the questions posed at the start of the course.  PLEASE NOTE: This course is open only to NYU Abu Dhabi students.  This course includes a required international trip to Italy.	0	0
1282	1282	WRIT-UH	1003J	Global Discoveries and Dialogues: Histories of and in Greece	“Global Discoveries and Dialogues” examines the case for the “universal museum” through the twin lenses of global history and global heritage management. It explores different approaches to memorialization, and considers how to strike an appropriate balance between the desire to showcase “golden ages” and theresponsibility to restore silenced voices. Beginning in Abu Dhabi, both sections will meet together to discuss global cultural heritage, before visiting the Louvre Abu Dhabi.

1283	1283	WRIT-UH	1004J	Global Discoveries: From Athena to Athens, Myth - Past and Present	'Global Discoveries: From Athena to Athens, Myth - Past and Present' examines myths as templates understanding the human experience and resonating across cultural boundaries to offer a pattern of being and a way of thinking tied to the past, present, and future. Students will analyze various texts to examine how myths connect human narratives, social contracts and expressions of human existence to understand: “Why are we here?” “Who are we?” “What is our purpose?” Through an exploration of a diverse group of Athenian landmarks, history, literature and material culture, the course will challenge students to establish criteria for determining whether these sites and their attached histories have a larger significance, “outstanding universal value,” and “importance to the collective interests of humanity.”	0	0

1285	1285	WRIT-UH	1100	FYWS: Taste, Culture & the Self	“There’s no accounting for taste,” the old saying goes. We like our favorite shoes, cars, and paintings for reasons that simply can’t be explained. This FYWS challenges that assumption. Taking contemporary popular culture as a point of departure, the course delves into debates from history, sociology, and literary studies in order to understand the social construction of taste, giving special attention to the complex role that “good taste” or “bad taste” can play in perpetuating social hierarchies. Students will develop reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills while examining how ideas about “taste” are constructed, interrelated, and how they can inform, limit, or inspire the way we see ourselves in our social worlds.	0	0
1286	1286	WRIT-UH	1101	FYWS: Imagined Geographies	We think of locales as something physical, something experienced. We know where we are (and where we are from) partly because we have physical experiences of those places: a grandmother’s kitchen, a smell of the city, the particular light on Scandinavian summer nights, or the sound of the jungle. But what if our sense of geographies—and their relation to identity (national and/or personal)—comes from written sources and visual texts rather than direct experience? How do texts “imagine” geographies? This FYWS takes up a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts in order to investigate how space and national and/or personal identity is imagined. Students will investigate how texts open a space for readers to imagine unknown worlds and geographies. Readings include essays, short stories, and poems that all attempt to capture an experience of self in relation to a locale. Writers will include Joan Didion, Richard Blanco, Tony Kushner, and Jamaica Kincaid. Theoretical texts include work by Edward Said, Benedict Anderson, Judith Butler, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak.	0	0
1287	1287	WRIT-UH	1102X	FYWS: Contemporary Debates of Islam	Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about “Islam.” Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes Islam, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as informed commentary on Islam often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives. With these challenges in mind, this FYWS focuses on contemporary debates about the history, society, and culture of Islam. The course begins by grappling with contesting representations of Islam by Bernard Lewis, Edward Said, Robert Spencer, and Samuel Huntington. It then delves into some prominent sites of conflict and tension brought to the fore by such events as the Charlie Hebdo affair and the burqa controversy as well as the rise in Islamophobia in Europe. For the research paper, students will focus on the role of struggle and conflict in Islam.	0	0
1288	1288	WRIT-UH	1103	FYWS: Ghastly Beauty	(Formerly WRIT-AD 143)Why do Shakespeare’s tragedies offer us hope? What makes a movie about a drug addicted professional wrestler more a story about love than the violence inherent his life? How does a beautiful painting or song make us cry? Art flourishes in a world of opposites and contradictions. Art is reflective and provocative, reactionary and thoughtful, private and public. As one of our oldest methods of documenting what we see, it also reconfigures and transforms what we imagine. This freshman writing seminar will serve as an introduction to these tensions, and the social, political and material roles that art plays in our life. It will familiarize you with academic writing, and further develop your critical reading, thinking and writing skills. It will draw from a range of art forms that explore both current social issues, and more enduring questions.The course texts cover a wide range of artistic culture and practice: from Paleolithic cave painting and sculpture, to contemporary mural painting – including the work of Harring, Rivera, Fazlalizadeh, Banksy, and Zabou. Readings will explore the relationship between art and nature. The paradox of tragic beauty is exemplified in short stories, films, plays, and in the work of Frieda Kahlo, Odd Nerdrum, Evelyn de Morgan, and Sue Coe. Joe Sacco’s, Palestine highlights the inevitable ties that art has to politics and society, and provides an entre into another twofold idea: conflict and resolution. Crucially, they will help facilitate the discussions, writing assignments and oral presentations in the class.Our first paper responds to only one of the written or visual texts examined in the first few weeks of class. By crafting an argument around a close and careful reading of the chosen text the writer learns how to read as a writer, and to formulate an interesting, arguable thesis. Paper two engages with several texts and the form of those texts will vary. An essay, a film and play, for example, provide ideal material for a fascinating textual dialogue. Finally, the oral presentation in advance of the last paper will help organize and outline the final written assignment, a longer, argument based research paper, on a debate or controversy in the art world. In this paper the writer must take a stand, as he/she becomes familiar with research methods, working with primary texts, and seeking out reliable, secondary sources.	0	0
1289	1289	WRIT-UH	1104X	FYWS: Understanding Shari’a	The universality of Shari‘a is a topic of intense debate in the contemporary world. Some assume the universality of Shari‘a as they outline the necessity of its reform. Other writers regard its universal aspirations as a “threat” to “Western” values. Still others remain skeptical that the Shari‘a was ever meant to be universal. Without answering the question of whether it is, was, or should be “universal,” this writing course investigates the debates that the question has inspired. How do different writers perceive the universality of Shari‘a? What are the political, ethical, or other stakes of arguments about Shari‘a’s universality? Readings connect theoretical approaches to individual case studies in milieus as diverse as shari‘a courts in Ottoman Turkey, fatwa councils in contemporary Egypt, and divorce proceedings in Iran. Through creative and critical writing assignments, students explore the contexts, motives, and forms of evidence brought to bear by authors who contribute to ongoing debates about the ways we understand Shari‘a today.	0	0
1290	1290	WRIT-UH	1105	FYWS: The Outsider	What does it mean to be an “outsider”? Artists, filmmakers, journalists and activists have described and adopted this position for a range of purposes. This FYWS sets out to discover why outsiders are both essential and potentially dangerous. The figure of “the outsider” is often clueless—or in over his head—or ignorant. But ignorance can be liberating, fostering open-mindedness and a chance to weave complexity back into dead narratives. Crucially, analyzing the role of the outsider across a range of texts and cultures will help us question the act of belonging. Biss’s Notes from No Man’s Land will aid in our investigation, as will essays by Binyavanga Wainaina and Suketu Mehta. In order to understand outsiders with adopted countries the course will consider Katherine Boo’s book about Mumbai’s destitute, Behind the Beautiful Forevers. Documentaries by Mads Brugger and Joshua Oppenheimer help explore how “the outsider” is sometimes seen as a master manipulator and exploiter. Such readings lead us to ask: who exploits whom?	0	0
1291	1291	WRIT-UH	1106	FYWS: Records	What drives humans to record events or experiences? And how has that drive shaped not only the history of human communication but also of record-keeping itself? What is the relationship between events and the records we make of them, from notebook entries, to sound files, to selfies, to receipts? Is there tension between ideals documentary fidelity and new possibilities for art and imagination? When is the memorializing goal better served by invention than recording? Examining a series of technological innovations and theories of media, the course will focus most closely on the intersecting histories of writing and sound recording. Student essays will address different forms of artistic and scholarly work, including diaries and journals; early sound recordings and films; contemporary art and conceptual poetry; dystopian television series; and neurobiological research on memory. The final library research paper builds on these course materials to explore fundamental questions about memory, history, technology, and the relationship between art and life.	0	0
1292	1292	WRIT-UH	1107	FYWS: Street Food	What is the relationship between food and food habits, between what is eaten in cities and what people crave, what’s in one day, out the next? This is a class about history and politics, the bond between immigrants and street/cheap food, and the significance of Abu Dhabi's many cafeterias. Students will tackle essays about lobster, food trucks, and ice cream; fiction by surrealists; and films about noodle makers and couscous masters. Drawing on your analysis of these texts, you will be asked to produce several essays in draft and final form in which you make original arguments about Abu Dhabi’s food scene/culture. Fact: there’s little written about Abu Dhabi’s street food. Our goal will be to try to rectify that and to determine how food is connected to the city’s evolving soul. “Street Food” is a class about observation and immersion: you will have mandatory off-campus assignments, requiring you to venture into the city, sample cheap eats, and comment and write about what’s being eaten, what ingredients are most sought after, what’s good, and what’s not.	0	0
1293	1293	WRIT-UH	1108	FYWS: Writers on Writing	Why do people write? How do different cultures understand writing? How is writing valued and assessed? How do we learn to write? What happens when we consider the process of writing a complex affective and neurological process? These are some of the questions raised in this seminar by studying not only how writers write but, more importantly, how writers make sense of both their writing and their process. It is seemingly the simplest of acts: sit down, get out a pen or put your fingers to the keyboard, and start transferring thought into written matter. However, the act of writing is a complex neurological, psychological, imaginative, and cultural practice. This seminar will focus on writers and their expressive practice in an attempt to understand the process and material manifestation of writing. A fundamental tenet of the class is that writers and writing  must be understood in their cultural and contextual complexities.	0	0
1294	1294	WRIT-UH	1109	FYWS: Questions of Fatherhood	What forms of knowledge, political conditions or social relations become visible when the figure of the father is put into question? This First Year Writing Seminar adopts feminist modes of inquiry to interrogate the figure of the father in a range of diverse social contexts in the contemporary world. Readings draw on a range of texts including political theory, history, ethnography, film, and memoir that weave across Europe, the Gulf, and the United States. Students will take the following three questions as guides for each text: How do we know the father? What threats, anxieties, hopes and promises take shape through the figure of the father? How is the figure of the father related to broader patterns of political authority (e.g. race, class, sexual orientation)?	0	0
1295	1295	WRIT-UH	1110	FYWS: Power and Ethics in Photography	Since its invention in 1839, photography has come to dominate our lives in ways that would have been unthinkable to the medium’s pioneers—so much so that it’s almost impossible to imagine what a world without photographs might look like. The recent rise in smartphone technology and social media networks raises old and new questions about how photography alters the way we see and know the world, including important ethical questions about the medium’s intrusive and seductive nature. Drawing on the writings of Sontag, Sischy, Said and others, this FYWS analyzes photography’s power in shaping our collective consciousness, but also the limitations on capturing reality. Beginning with a fundamental division between “art” and “documentary” photography, students will delve into the ethics and aesthetics of portraying pain, tragedy, and death. They will explore how cameras can create illusions and how photographic representations of “otherness” can help reinforce existing power structures and dominant narratives about “us” and “them.” In addition to drafting and writing three argumentative essays, students will create and present a photo-essay of 8 to 10 images.	0	0
1296	1296	WRIT-UH	1111	FYWS: “Cowboys & Indians”: Mythologies of American Identity	(Formerly WRIT-AD 151)Images and depictions of the American West offer a repository of profound and enduring stories, some dating back thousands of years, far in advance of the European “discovery.” Art and literature depicting the American frontier and its complex indigenous cultures reflect a wide array of beliefs and ideologies. This Writing Seminar invites students into a close and careful examination of the written, oral and visual representations of the American West in order to analyze and explore the mythologies that contribute to a national identity. These representations are often set against a backdrop of unimaginable physical beauty and natural wonder. Yet in them we also find unprecedented violence and racism. The social, political, and philosophical movements influencing Europe (among them colonialism, romanticism, capitalism, socialism, existentialism, and racism) followed the “pioneers” across the plains. This Writing Seminar will explore and analyze these tensions that seem to define the “American character”: the tribal versus the rugged individual, progress and our disregard for the natural world, tolerance and the intolerable, nostalgia for a vanishing landscape in the wake of unbridled development, law and order and frontier justice. These mythic tales about the promise of America continue to fascinate and frustrate. All of it-- the ‘good the bad and the ugly’-- have contributed to the representations of what it means to be “American.” To help us consider questions of genre, the course will consider stories and essays by American and Native American writers. We will begin with The Sun’s Myth, a story in the oral tradition of the Kathlamet Chinook, and a Navajo Night Chant, House Made of the Dawn, translated by Washington Matthews and Dorothy Johnson. Students will be asked to engage in a close formal analysis of a range of visual and written texts, from John Gast’s painting, American Progress, to the essay “Manifest Destiny –A Belief System that Created a Nation,” to the journalism of Jane Cazneau and an excerpt from the Journals of Lewis and Clark. To help us reckon with the ethics of storytelling and representation we will consider “classic Westerns” such as High Noon and The Magnificent Seven, and “revisionist Westerns” such as Thunderheart, Little Big Man, as well as  Reel Injuns (2009), a documentary by Cree filmmaker Neil Diamond.	0	0
1297	1297	WRIT-UH	1112	FYWS: Time	(Formerly WRIT-AD 152)“Time” … a single word, a simple word, and—beyond reading the face of a watch—a term few understand (although all worry about).   We sometimes reflect upon it, but usually—for most—just for a few brief seconds, as we “don’t have the time for this.”  Now, in this course, we will take the time to consider “Time” in order to build a personal philosophy to account for what we will choose to do with our time, often combatting what our culture tries to impose upon us.  In this First-Year Writing Seminar you will have the opportunity to further develop your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills while examining how ideas about time are constructed and interrelated, and how they can inform, limit, or inspire the way we see ourselves in our social worlds.  Potential topics are summed up best, perhaps, on the cover of the Spring 2012 issue of Scientific American entitled “A Matter of Time”: this course will similarly explore subtopics such as 1) The Mind and Time; 2) The Philosophy of Time; 3) Time and Culture; 4) Ultimate Clocks; 5) Time’s Mysterious Physics; and 6) Building Time Machines. Our weekly work will consist of reading a range of texts, writing in a variety of modes, and collaborating closely with one another.	0	0
1298	1298	WRIT-UH	1113	FYWS: Saving Strangers: Debates about Humanitarian Intervention	Can humanitarian intervention ever be morally justified? Humanitarian intervention is one of the most controversial concepts of international politics, and the list of arguments for and against using military force to address extreme human suffering, such as genocide and ethnic cleansing, is long. It seems that no single argument—legal, political, or ethical—adequately captures the principal views on the justice of the phenomenon and that perspectives on these questions are as diverse as the individuals and groups who either implement them or are the object of interventions. Thus, fundamental questions remain: Does our membership in a common humanity require us to engage in the act of killing to save others? Or is it an unacceptable onslaught on state sovereignty? This FYWS will pursue these questions through various writing exercises and assignments designed to help students explore and engage with different arguments about the ways we understand humanitarian intervention today.	0	0
1299	1299	WRIT-UH	1114	FYWS: Contextualizing Travel Narratives	The central locus of inquiry for this seminar is the question of travel narratives’ completeness, trustworthiness, and impact as visual and textual representations of other cultures. How do travel narratives help us know what we think we know about other cultures? Travel narratives, which have historically provided crucial information about faraway places, have also participated, often unknowingly, in the creation of persistent stereotypes about the cultures depicted. In order to understand the origins and influence of such representations and stereotyping, we will carefully examine the context and impact of travel narratives. By closely analyzing films, plays, prose, and travelogues that share a narrative theme of journeying into foreign territories students will ask how preconceived notions about others originate. Informed by Edward Said’s influential theory on orientalism—as well as by postcolonial, cultural and gender studies—the seminar will explore how power imbalances might influence the ways in which cultural encounters are depicted and interpreted.	0	0
1300	1300	WRIT-UH	1115	FYWS: The Art and Aesthetics of International Aid	In communities beset by war, disaster, or poverty,  art may seem an unaffordable luxury, yet expressive culture flourishes in concert and in combat with crisis, not merely in spite of it. As global emergencies and internationally funded responses dictate the conditions of life in more and more places, they also inspire new forms of aesthetic experience and engagement. Aid agencies sponsor art and media through sensitization campaigns and the promotion of local craft industries. They and their beneficiaries also arrange the perception of everyday living, whether through the choreography of resource distribution, the sculpting of infrastructure, the architecture of refugee camps, the staging of post-conflict justice and reconciliation, or the orchestration of political participation. Such projects mobilize the senses in ways fundamental to their reception, implementation, and impact. While policy-makers define development and humanitarianism through rhetoric that vacillates between morality and pragmatism, the aesthetics of such interventions often determine which problems are visible or invisible, which people are audible or inaudible, and which acts are sensible or senseless.	0	0
1301	1301	WRIT-UH	1116	FYWS: The Politics of Spectacle	Political spectacle is often disparaged as “style over substance,” an image of action rather than action itself. Yet if spectacle is merely façade, why has it proved to be such a powerful tool in so many historical, geographical, and cultural contexts? Rulers and masses envision society through public display: rallies, demonstrations, festivals, rituals, trials, executions, etc. Such events both reveal and mask struggles over governance, privacy, globalization, religion, tradition, and change. This FYWS surveys an array of spectacles in order to discern how they work and to whose benefit: the spectator or the spectated? Course materials include model case studies from anthropology, political science, philosophy, and performance studies, as well as visual texts including film, photography, and social media. Writing assignments will challenge students to describe, analyze, and contextualize political power and its expression, leading to a sustained research paper on a topic of their choice. Students will pay particular attention to how their writing balances between word and image, between charged emotion and academic rigor, and between themselves and their publics.	0	0
1302	1302	WRIT-UH	1117	FYWS: We Broke the Weather	Idle weather chit-chat was once the essence of a banal neighborly ritual; today, philosopher Timothy Morton argues that global climate change has loaded these pleasantries with existential fear and wonder. Asking if it’s “Hot enough for ya?” in 2018, after a decade of escalating temperature records, means contemplating nothing less than the end of the world. Set aside, for a moment, fears of rising seas, failing monsoons, and ancient pathogens released from soggy permafrost: how do we rewrite the stories we tell about our place in the world, now that we’ve grown big enough to break the weather? This writing seminar investigates the philosophical, narrative, and moral fallout of global warming. By close-reading the climate through a wide variety of texts (including journalism, philosophy, poetry, policy, prophecy, science fiction, and manifestos), we’ll begin answering the questions that await us all in the decades to come: How do we tell the story of climate change? Where do we imagine ourselves among its many possible futures? In a final library paper, students will examine a contemporary case study to weigh the moral dilemmas this warming world presents.	0	0
1303	1303	WRIT-UH	1118	FYWS: Citizens of Nowhere	When UK Prime Minister Theresa May said, “If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere” she aligned global citizenship with those whom she calls “international elites.” But citizens of nowhere are everywhere: they might be the children of China’s nouveau riche splurging in Vancouver, contestants on the popular American reality show The Amazing Race, Filipina helpers strolling the parks of Hong Kong on their Sundays off, and you, the students of NYU Abu Dhabi.This writing seminar investigates questions around notions of global citizenship, cosmopolitan ethics, and liberal education. We’ll use philosophical texts, journalistic essays, film, fiction, podcasts, and reality television to ask: What does it mean to be a global citizen, and who can become one? What does the cosmopolitan worldview offer us? Why might we be wary of patriotism, and when might we embrace it? In the final third of the course, we will bring our consideration of cosmopolitanism and nationalism to bear as we examine global higher education and NYU’s own Global Network University, an institution both founded on cosmopolitan ideals and bound by its physical campuses inside national borders.	0	0
1304	1304	WRIT-UH	1119	FYWS: Living Cities	We often think of cities as collections of buildings, streets, and people. But what if we see them as living entities, with their own histories, identities, and subcultures? This FYWS sets out to investigate and map three distinct cities: Mumbai, Kampala, and Abu Dhabi. Considering each city as shaped by the ways citizens “practice” their everyday activities, students will examine different ways each city is represented in film, fiction, travel narratives, and scholarship from such fields as media, literary, and postcolonial studies . In the case of Abu Dhabi, students will also experience the city as pedestrians. Writing assignments include one essay on each city, each increasing in complexity, and each following different lines of inquiry: How is the city represented and shaped in different media? What are its stereotypes? Its conceptions of otherness or cosmopolitanism? What is urban culture and how does it differ from national culture? Who gets to claim a city as home? In the final research project and oral presentations, students will choose a method of inquiry and point of interest in Abu Dhabi, and in the process have to consider their own identities as its inhabitants.	0	0
1305	1305	WRIT-UH	1120	FYWS: Inventions of Childhood	What is childhood? While we tend to think about childhood as a natural, biological category, this First-Year Writing Seminar will address ways in which different societies have invented and shaped their own definitions of this concept. By critically engaging with a corpus of primary and secondary sources, students will think about permanence and change across time and geographical areas and in doing do redefine ideas we often take for granted. Materials will include academic texts, newspaper articles, travel accounts, short stories, comic books, and movies. Class discussions and writing assignments will focus on the following questions: How do we know what we know about childhood? How do notions of gender, class, and race inform definitions of childhood? And what is the relevance of the past to our understanding of childhood in the present?	0	0
1306	1306	WRIT-UH	1121	FYWS: Making Sense of Scents	Scent is one of life’s greatest pleasures, deeply tied to culture and memory—and yet much about how and why we smell remains mysterious. This First-Year Writing Seminar draws on many disciplines to examine ties between scent, science, and culture. Does smell have an evolutionary history? Can a concept like synesthesia—the connection between different senses—allow us to write expressively about smells, describe and analyze fragrances or flavors, or argue about scent’s place in a hierarchy of human senses? Readings include classical and Islamic philosophy, religious texts, medieval alchemy and sorcery, modern philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and the history of science. Field trips to perfumeries, gardens, art exhibitions, restaurants, and campus laboratories allow for interviews with a range of practitioners. Digital exercises enable the analysis of complex chemical data. Students will learn to compare, synthesize, and write effectively about methods and sources as they ask how disparate forms of evidence help us better understand biological attraction, constructions of beauty, feelings of disgust, and why we entangle odors with ideas about gender, race, and ethnicity.	0	0
1307	1307	WRIT-UH	1122	FYWS: Worlds Connected, Worlds Apart	In the modern world, people believe themselves to be more closely connected than ever before. But might connectivity both deepen and potentially obstruct our common understanding? This writing seminar critically examines the notions of modern connectivity and communication. By framing connectivity and communication as trans-regional and cross-cultural processes, this course questions global political structures and social-cultural trends that shape our beliefs and allows students to question some common assumptions about how people form relationships with each other. Course materials draw on seminal texts in the field of global history, including excerpts from Bayly’s The Birth of the Modern World, 1780–1914, and on essays and scholarly articles from fields such as sociology, anthropology, history, and communication studies. Through readings, class discussions, presentations, peer critique, and writing assignments, this course will deepen students’ understanding of communication--and miscommunication--in the world we have inherited.	0	0
1308	1308	WRIT-UH	1123	FYWS:  Scientific Knowledge	The physical, natural, experimental sciences are advancing at an ever-accelerating rate to furnish our world with increasingly advanced technology. What are the origins of modern scientific research, how should we manage its current trajectory, and where will that path eventually lead us? This course seeks to explore these questions on science in society and knowledge management by drawing on readings from the history and philosophy of science, as well as contemporary scientific controversies. The first essay will be based on a close reading of Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and Galilei’s Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, which provide a philosophical and historical grounding for the course. The second essay will construct an analytical framework centered on writings by Orwell and Sagan that debate the proper way for societies to manage and interact with the ever-expanding body of scientific fact-based knowledge. Finally, in the third essay, students will choose a contemporary controversy in science or technology to explore in depth: they will imagine a near future and explain it in terms of the themes of the course.	0	0
1309	1309	WRIT-UH	1124	FYWS: Slavery After Slavery	In the nineteenth century, most states in Africa and the Atlantic world outlawed slavery. Abolition was a revolutionary act that put an end to the legal sale and ownership of human beings. However, official abolition often coexisted with new or old forms of systemic labor exploitation, political domination, and violence. This FYWS invites students to explore this paradox of change and permanence across cultures in Africa and the Atlantic world. How did different economic structures and geopolitical dynamics determine the lived experiences of servitude and liberation? To what extent did religion influence slavery systems and emancipation processes? How did enslaved and freed people in the colonies shape the theory and practice of European abolitionism? Perceptions of freedom and slavery in the nineteenth century were different from ours, and so the course will seek to understand how these fluid ideas shaped people’s lives in real ways. Students will reconsider concepts often taken for granted as they engage with academic texts, photographs, newspaper articles, autobiographies, and films.	0	0
1310	1310	WRIT-UH	1125	FYWS: Graphic Violence	Our lives seem ever more beset by acts of violence, from widespread war and autocratic politics to intimate abuse and harassment; meanwhile, our entertainment seems ever more saturated with representations of violence, from news and viral videos to the fantastical carnage of superhero films and the carnal fantasy of Game of Thrones. Yet debates about how such representations relate to real-world brutality often overlook how definitions of violence hinge on concepts as disparate as nature, culture, force, injury, deprivation, and desire. Such mutations of meaning are not mere semantics; how we represent violence defines our response to it. Playing on the term “graphic,” this FYWS explores the ways we write about and with violence. In their first essay, students engage with debates on violence’s entanglements with representation. Next, students synthesize theoretical perspectives on violence (e.g. postcolonial, feminist, Marxist). Finally, they tackle a research topic of their own choosing while comparing case studies from disciplines and domains including cinema, art exhibitions, and video games. Throughout, the course aims for awareness of diverse experiences and sensitivities.	0	0
1311	1311	WRIT-UH	1126	FYWS: Understanding Postcolonial Feminisms	"""I’m a feminist but…"" How many times have we heard that? Or its twin: ""I'm not a feminist but...""? What is it about this label (the ""F word"") that seems to complicate one's personal identification with gender equality? Do such statements betray a fear of group identification? A fear of universalist thinking? This FYWS explores a range of texts and media in which postcolonial writers, artists, and intellectuals negotiate issues of gender, class, identity, and culture in understanding the impact of feminism in decolonization. Students will explore cultural developments and political narratives in a range of genres and learn to analyze techniques and contexts of feminist and postcolonial thought and expression. Two interrelated concerns motivate the writing assignments: 1) What is the relationship between women’s voices and their agency in the postcolonial context? 2) How do these writers mobilize the category of gender to negotiate understandings of individual and community in these regions? Consideration of various cultural, racial, class, and national perspectives will initiate a deeper understanding of postcolonial feminism and its contribution to ongoing political developments."	0	0
1312	1312	WRIT-UH	1127	FYWS: Real and Imagined: Women’s Writing Across Worlds	"How do women writers across the world negotiate social and political questions about their place in society? How do they interpret expectations of the maternal ideal, of the primary caregiver, of the silenced and the marginalized? And how are these identities complicated by the privilege of class, race, citizenship, heterosexuality, and various definitions of ""femininity""? Looking at contemporary creative nonfiction, memoir, and confessional writing by women from different parts of the world, this FYWS explores how women writers contest structures of power and articulate identities through self-representation. Drawing upon various genres of life-writing, the course falls into three parts: Between Cultures; Maternal Matrix; and Private Lives, Publicly. Materials reflect on women’s experience of migration, of subverting traditional gendered norms, and of crossing boundaries of self-censorship and voicing experiences publicly, while also considering critically the ethics of representing “true” material from life history or observation, and the responsibility writers have towards others."	0	0
1313	1313	WRIT-UH	1128	FYWS: Memory, History, and Forgetting	Why do we remember some events and forget others? How do we come to know facts about the past that we haven’t experienced ourselves? How do our memories of the past shape the person we are today? These are some key questions addressed in this writing seminar. Drawing upon a range of materials including conceptual texts, memoirs, witness testimonies, archives, museums, history textbooks, and film, this course sheds light on the processes through which individual and social memory are constructed, mediated, disseminated and received. The seminar also focuses on how words, symbols, objects, and spaces become carriers and sites of memory. Some themes to be explored include the relationship between history and collective memory, commemoration and national identity, and the role of memory in peace and conflict. Classes will combine reading discussions, writing exercises, film screenings, onsite visits, and oral presentations through which students will be invited to think about the workings of their own memories and the ways in which these memories interplay with their histories and their identities.	0	0
1314	1314	WRIT-UH	1129	FYWS: The World of Babel: Translation Before the Modern Age	Translators and interpreters have been an important part of society in every age, but they are often the unsung heroes of successful cultural exchange, diplomatic negotiations, or trade deals. It is only when they make mistakes that they become visible, because their purpose is to ensure that communication happens smoothly. In this Writing Seminar, we will shine a light on how translation practices and the people in this profession were regarded in ancient and medieval times. How was translation defined and discussed? What place did it have in society? What roles did its practitioners have and where do they appear in the historical record? And, on a more theoretical level, how did people think about translation practices in different pre-modern cultures and why? We will work with original translations and works about translation from the Middle East, Europe, and Asia to try and answer some of these questions, while reflecting on modern circumstances of multilingual interaction. Through assigned readings, written papers, guided class discussions, and presentations, students will be invited to compare and contrast different traditions of translation.	0	0
1315	1315	WRIT-UH	1130	FYWS: Speaking of Sickness	How do our backgrounds influence our understanding of disease and affect the kind of treatment we receive? Is it acceptable to refuse healthcare for oneself or others? When does providing care become an act of coercion or oppression? How do politicians and non-profits exploit medical metaphors in order to manipulate the behavior of their audience? In discussing such questions, this Writing Seminar explores the medical humanities, drawing upon literature, art, history, and anthropology to examine the culturally situated experiences of being ill and treating illness. We will consider how social and cultural factors shape perceptions of wellness and disease, with particular attention to the role of language. Topics for analysis will include the organ donation process, healthcare for immigrant groups, medical rhetoric in politics, and college policies on medical leave. Our texts will reflect the interdisciplinary nature of these topics, featuring authors such as the bioethicist Tom Beauchamp, anthropologist Anne Fadiman, and literary critic Susan Sontag. Together, we will examine what Sontag calls our “dual citizenship” in the “kingdom of the well” and the “kingdom of the sick.”	0	0
